# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash Evaluation (deepseek41)

**Status**: active — artifact download in progress (started 2026-09-22 09:51, about 13 h at
~11 MB/s); official reference implementation and harness fetched. No port, build or inference yet.
**Created**: 2026-09-22 (operator retargeting of INF-69: "translate the GLM-5.3-Flash handoffs to
target DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash instead (assuming they are applicable)")
**Priority**: MEDIUM — novel-under-test model replacing the deleted GLM-5.3-Flash
**Categories**: inference_serving, local_inference, kernel_architecture, speculative_decoding
**Workstream**: Inference Acceleration
**Parent index**: [`inference-research-index.md`](inference-research-index.md) (row INF-77, replaces INF-69)

## Artifact identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Official source | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`, `DeepseekV41ForCausalLM`, `model_type=deepseek_v41`, 763.2B params, FP8 block scale [32,32] (`scale_fmt=ue8m0`, `expert_dtype=fp4`), ~510 GB safetensors (48 shards) |
| Official non-weight files | `/mnt/raid0/llm/models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash/` (`inference/` reference impl incl. `model.py`/`engram.py`/`kernel.py`, `encoding/`, `evaluation/dsh-minimal.patch`, tech report PDF, config, tokenizer) |
| Official harness | `/mnt/raid0/llm/deepseek-harness` (github `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` @ `c36a83ff6b`, MIT) |
| Serving artifact | `antirez/deepseek-v4.1-flash-gguf` Q4: `.part1` 480.0 GB + `.part2` 38.6 GB, joined into `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-Q4.gguf` (482.98 GiB) under `/mnt/raid0/llm/models/antirez/deepseek-v4.1-flash-gguf/` |
| GGUF architecture | **`deepseek41`**, not `deepseek4`. Calibrated for antirez's ds4 Metal runtime (`antirez/ds4`, branch `ds4.1flash`) |
| Quant mix | Q4_K routed experts; Q8 attention projections, shared experts and output; F16/F32 elsewhere (e.g. `attn_compressor_kv` F16) |
| Engram tables | Native FP8 stored as GGML `I8`; `blk.N.engram_embd.weight` shape (264, 384006168): 256 FP8 bytes + 8 scale bytes per row; 188.83 GiB total; ds4 streams rows from disk |
| MTP / DSpark | **CORRECTED 2026-09-22 (DS41-B0).** `num_nextn_predict_layers=3` is the 3-block **DSpark drafter**, not 3 next-token heads: block of 5, bidirectional in-block, own 128-expert/top-3 MoE, rank-256 Markov head and confidence head, embed/head tied to the backbone (`inference/model.py:1032-1156`). It ships in the official shards 44-46 (~8 GB, 2,401 `mtp.*` tensors). **The antirez GGUF does NOT contain it** — its converter omits every `mtp.*`/`vision.*`/`aligner.*` tensor (`gguf-tools/deepseek41_quantize.py:149`), and the header we read confirms 1046 tensors, `blk.0-39` only, zero `mtp.*`. The earlier "MTP retained" reading came from the embedded HF-config KV string, which antirez writes and never reads. vcruz's GGUF strips it too. |
| Tensor names | V4-family llama.cpp names (27/36 per-block names identical to vcruz305's converted GGUF); antirez extras `attn_compressor_{gate,kv,norm}`, `engram_{embd,kv,q_norm,k_norm}` |

**Config deltas vs V4 (from `config.json`, verify each against `inference/model.py`)**: 40 layers,
hidden 5120, 384 routed experts / top-6 + 1 shared, `sqrtsoftplus` scoring; sliding window 128;
cross-layer KV sharing (`kv_source_layer_ids=[2,8,14,20]`); indexer sharing
(`index_source_layer_ids=[2,8,14,20,24,28,32,36]`, 32 heads × 128, `index_topk=512`); two-level
candidate block selection (`candidate_source_layer_id=20`, `candidate_topk_blocks=2048`,
`candidate_block_size=8`); hyper-connections `hc_mult=4`, 20 Sinkhorn iterations; Engram at layers
1 and 14 (max n-gram 4, 8 heads × 256). The config's `dspark_*` fields (block 5, target layers 37-39, Markov rank 256, noise token
128799) are **live, and their weights ship under the `mtp.*` namespace** — the earlier "no DSpark
tensors" reading was wrong (DS41-B0).

## Runtime status (verified 2026-09-22)

- Production v9 (`0db32c06e`) has `deepseek4` (upstream #24162) with indexer top-k, compressor,
  hyper-connections and a `LLM_GRAPH_TYPE_DECODER_MTP` graph (`src/models/deepseek4.cpp`). It
  does **not** register `deepseek41`, so the artifact cannot load on any production binary.
- Upstream convert PR ggml-org/llama.cpp#28696 (vcruz305, open) adds `deepseek41` conversion.
  Runtime WIP is on `vcruz305/llama.cpp` branch `runtime/deepseek41`: loader, Engram and
  hyper-connections are reported verified against the reference; sparse attention is still open.
  vcruz's GGUFs strip MTP.
- **Required path**: an experimental port. Per the CLAUDE.md four-step workflow it starts from a
  fresh branch off the current champion/production lineage, and it must include (a) an Engram
  FP8-row get_rows/dequant op for the I8-packed table and (b) native 3-layer MTP. **Speculative
  decoding is required by the operator.**

## Translated from INF-69 — findings that carry over (verify on deepseek41 before relying on them)

1. **Dense-mask risk.** GLM-5.2's generic DSA path computed top-k and then ran final attention
   over full KV with a mask. Establish whether `deepseek4`'s `build_lid_top_k` path gathers
   sparsely or masks, then whether the V4.1 candidate-block level changes that. Never claim
   long-context sparse-compute value without the answer.
2. **Top-k cap corruption.** On GLM-5.2 an under-sized final-attention cap corrupted output past
   the cap. Re-derive this for `index_topk=512` plus the 2048-block candidate stage; do not
   transfer thresholds.
3. **MTP gate contract** (from the GLM-5.3 port): parallel verification must be row-exact
   (batch non-invariance alone reproduced the first GLM mismatch). Parity at one draft depth
   proves nothing about another. Multi-ubatch prefill needs its own MTP selection-width
   regression. Rollback must restore every stateful surface: KV, compressor, indexer, the
   cross-layer shared KV/index state, and hyper-connection streams.
4. **Evidence contract** for any long-output, throughput or quality probe: streaming progress,
   retained trace logs, server-log timing extraction, a minimum completion-token floor, and
   in-window contention witnesses. A GLM Q8 "win" of 1.0497x was an 8.41-vs-1.82 CPU-equivalent
   load artifact. Record every quality claim with `(prompt tokens, top-k settings)`.

## Tasks

### A — Acquisition and reference

- [x] DS41-A0 — Start the antirez Q4 download (two raw parts). ✅ 2026-09-22 09:51
- [x] DS41-A1 — Fetch the official non-weight files (reference `inference/`, `encoding/`,
  `evaluation/`, tech report, config, tokenizer) and clone `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`
  @ `c36a83ff6b`. ✅ 2026-09-22
- [ ] DS41-A2 — Join and verify the download. **The parts MUST be joined**: `blk.14.engram_embd`
  is the last tensor and straddles the boundary (starts at 417,215,660,032; part1 ends at
  480,000,000,000). Expect 1046 tensors / 518,583,635,408 B = 482.97 GiB total, engram 188.83 GiB,
  main weights 294.14 GiB, padded to a 16,384 multiple. Confirmed from the part1 header already:
  `blk.0-39` only, **zero `mtp.*`** (see DS41-B13). Confirm both parts' byte sizes against the HF
  manifest, then join per the upstream downloader (append `.part2` onto `.part1`, needs ~37 GiB
  free headroom, not a second full copy). Verify the joined size equals the sum of parts
  (482.98 GiB) and any publisher checksum, then remove the parts. Read the header: `general.architecture=deepseek41`,
  block count, `nextn` layers = 3, and the Engram tensor shapes/types listed above. Record ~200 GB
  free after the join; flag anything under that.

### B — Port (experimental only; production stays frozen)

- [x] DS41-B0 — **Decision package: port from vcruz `runtime/deepseek41` or write fresh on
  `deepseek4`.** (a) Adapt a pinned vcruz head: loader, Engram and hyper-connections are already
  reported against the reference, but sparse attention is unfinished, MTP is stripped, and the
  tensor names differ from antirez (9/36 per-block names plus the antirez extras need a compat
  map). (b) Extend production `deepseek4` fresh: MTP graph and hyper-connections already exist
  locally, but Engram, KV/index sharing and candidate blocks are written from `inference/model.py`.
  (c) Hybrid: take vcruz's Engram/loader deltas as reference only and build on `deepseek4`.
  Recommendation: **(c)**. Source-audit first (pin SHAs, diff vs `deepseek4.cpp`), same shape as
  the GLM-5.3 T0 audit. This is an engineering choice, not an operator gate; proceed on (c) unless
  the audit shows vcruz's sparse path is further along than reported.
  **RESOLVED 2026-09-22 → (c), reference only.** Four read-only audits (vcruz branch, our v10
  `deepseek4`, the antirez artifact + `antirez/ds4`, the official reference). Findings:
  - **vcruz `runtime/deepseek41` pinned at `5210c7c5ed61dddaee6ed476623abf4b63093d16`** (2026-09-12),
    16 commits / 20 files / +1866-63 over merge-base `311d4211` — which is **not** an ancestor of
    v10, is 228 commits behind master, and needs `ggml_rope_set_offset` back-ported. Its two most
    edited files (`src/models/deepseek4.cpp`, `src/llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp`) are exactly where v10
    carries our fused `ggml_dsv4_hc_pre/post` path, so a merge is HIGH conflict. Its sparse
    attention is still a **dense mask + top-k**, not a gather (`deepseek41.cpp:781-797`); the
    two-level candidate mask is absent and **caps the context** (`:32-34`); MTP absent. MIT, no DCO.
  - **v10 already covers ~55-60% of the non-Engram, non-vision backbone.** Free: `sqrtsoftplus`
    (v10 *requires* it), hyper-connections + Sinkhorn (parametric, `hc==4` asserted, fused CPU+CUDA
    op — better than vcruz's), MoE bias/route_scale/norm_topk_prob, Q4_K/Q8_0/MXFP4 experts,
    `TENSOR_READ_LAZY`. The lightning indexer is near-verbatim reusable and **already
    block-granular**; our top-k path is a real gather where vcruz's is a mask.
  - **Take from vcruz as reference/port, never as a merge**: the Engram host-side hash +
    `set_input`, the `{pre,post,comb}` lag refactor, the ratio/overlap generalisation in
    `llama-kv-cache-dsv4.cpp`, three shared-code fixes (kv-cache reuse loop, `build_input_k_rot`
    zero-layer guard, `has_cell_ext`), and the engram q/k quantization skip.
  - **Not in the brief, and now priced**: RoPE covers only the last 64 of 512 dims as *interleaved
    pairs*, with the **inverse rotation applied to the attention output** (no llama.cpp DeepSeek
    path does this); `compress_ratios` are {0,1,2} while our loader throws on anything but
    {0,4,128}; FP8 block scale is [32,32] `ue8m0` while our converter hardcodes 128; expert FP4
    scales run along K only, per output row.
  Effort, component by component: attention skeleton S · indexer S · HC free · MoE free · quant
  free · compress ratios M · cross-layer KV share S-M · index share M · candidate blocks S ·
  loader/converter M · **Engram L** · **DSpark L** · vision L (dropped). ✅ 2026-09-22
- [x] DS41-B1a — Branch created: **`experimental/deepseek41-port-20260923`** off the **current
  AutoKernel champion** `ak/champion/llama-cpp-ffc1bac82eec`, which today is exactly
  `ffc1bac82` = production-consolidated-v10 (champion reseeded on the freeze; 0 commits either
  way). Worktree `/mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp-experimental-deepseek41-20260923`. The frozen tree was
  not touched (still on `production-consolidated-v10`, clean). ✅ 2026-09-23
- [ ] DS41-B1b — Build CPU and HIP on that branch and prove linkage with
  `verify_ggml_linkage.sh`; record the build dirs under `kernels/builds/` (pre-flight P4: never
  build into `tmp`, evidence from an ephemeral root is inadmissible). Re-base onto the champion tip
  whenever the champion moves, per *Kernel work rides the champion* below.
- [ ] DS41-B2 — Arch registration and loader for `deepseek41`, with a tested antirez-name compat
  map and every tensor shape/type validated before weights load.
- [ ] DS41-B3 — Engram: a custom FP8-row get_rows plus dequant op for the I8-packed
  (264-byte row = 256 FP8 + 8 scale) table, bit-exact against `inference/engram.py` on sampled
  rows. Decide residency: the host has 1.1 TB RAM, so full-resident mmap is feasible, unlike ds4's
  disk-streaming design, but measure page-cache/NUMA placement rather than assume it.
- [ ] DS41-B4 — Hyper-connections (`hc_*`, 4 streams, 20 Sinkhorn iterations): reuse the
  `deepseek4` ops; confirm V4.1 parity including the MTP blocks' `hc_*`.
- [ ] DS41-B5 — Attention deltas: sliding window 128, cross-layer KV sharing, indexer sharing,
  and candidate-block selection. Correctness first; sparse-gather value is INF-31's gate.
- [ ] DS41-B6 — Native 3-layer MTP through `--spec-type draft-mtp`: load `nextn` blocks and
  dispatch `DECODER_MTP` for depths 1-3. Validate target/draft hidden-state semantics and index
  or KV sharing into draft iterations.

### K — GLM-5.3 AutoKernel keeps carried to V4.1

The GLM-5.3 CPU campaign left 28 kernel keeps that are **not in v10**. All touch generic
ggml-cpu code only (`quants.c`, `ggml-cpu.c`, `ops.cpp`, `iqk_dispatch.cpp`,
`iqk_gemm_kquants.cpp`, `iqk_quantize_min.cpp`): Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8 dot paths, FA, the lightning-indexer
f16 dot, MoE expert cohorts and row-exact MoE (`akm-moe-rowexact-qact-2d-partition` +18.168%,
`akm-moe-rowexact-weighted-slabs` +3.179%). V4.1's Q4_K routed experts, Q8 attention and DSA
indexer run on these paths. Every gain was measured **only** on
`serving:glm53-c463f601b-cpu-mtp-depth3-b2048-ub512`; none is a claim about v10 or about V4.1.

- [x] DS41-K0 — Preserve and port. The source branch `ak/glm53-recovered-accumulator-20260912` is
  pushed to `fork` (it was 5 commits ahead). It is cherry-picked onto v10 as
  `experimental/glm53-keeps-on-v10-20260922` (fork): 28 keeps plus the row-exact MTP prerequisite
  `04ffb8ad0`. Its generic ggml/llama-context/server parts are ported, and its GLM5Next-only tests are
  dropped. There was one conflict, in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. The CPU build compiles, with iqk symbols
  present. `test-rowexact-backend-toggle {dense,densef32,mmid}` exits 3 (`difference_witness=0`)
  **identically on the original `614ff2ba0`**, so this is not a port regression. The test's witness
  does not engage on this host as written; fix or retire it in K1. The 11 in-flight lane diffs from
  the deleted runs are in `artifacts/autokernel/glm53-inflight-candidates-20260922/`; they are
  unmeasured. ✅ 2026-09-22
- [ ] DS41-K1 — Cross-workload admission of the ported branch vs v10 on the current CPU roles,
  under the AutoKernel cross-workload keep gate: speed paired with quality/coherence, per keep or
  bisected. Survivors become a **v11 champion candidate** through the standard four-step workflow
  (full-candidate bench, no cherry-picks at promotion). The row-exact keeps must also pass the
  MTP exact-trajectory gates on an MTP role.
- [ ] DS41-K2 — Re-measure the surviving keeps on deepseek41 once DS41-T1 passes, and evaluate the
  11 in-flight candidates as AutoKernel seeds on the V4.1 surface.

### B0 follow-on — the work items the audit actually produced

Sources pinned 2026-09-22: antirez runtime `antirez/ds4` **`main` @ `0aaea5a238fb41a35106a551e73c8409dfb751ac`** (MIT, reusable with notice; the branch `ds4.1flash` named on the model card **does not exist**); vcruz `runtime/deepseek41` @ `5210c7c5`; official reference under `models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash/`.

- [ ] **DS41-B7 — Engram execution path** (**AutoKernel champion deliverable** — see *Kernel work
  rides the champion*; author it model-agnostically and fold it into the champion, do not leave it
  in the port branch).** The artifact ships `blk.{1,14}.engram_embd.weight` as
  GGML `I8`, `[264, rows]`, `deepseek41.engram.encoding = "e4m3_e8m0_32_row264"`: 256 E4M3 bytes +
  8 E8M0 bytes, one scale per 32 columns, `val = ldexpf(e4m3(code), scale-127)`, NaN guard on
  `code&127==127 || scale==255`. **`ggml_compute_forward_get_rows` has no I8 case — it `GGML_ABORT`s,
  and CPU `supports_op` returns true, so it builds and dies at the first forward.** Two routes:
  (i) a new I8-row gather + 264→256 dequant op, keeping the file as shipped; (ii) an offline
  requantize of the table to MXFP4 (97.3 GiB, whose scale *is* ue8m0) or Q8_0 (194.6 GiB), both
  already get_rows-supported. Price (i) against (ii) before writing either.
- [ ] **DS41-B8 — Engram addressing, host side.** 24 rows per token per engram layer (3 n-gram
  orders x 8 heads), 48 per token, 12.4 KB of random reads per token, on the decode critical path
  with no prefetch depth (the 4-gram suffix ends at the token just sampled). **The GGUF ships the
  complete hash spec** — `engram.token_map` (129,280 -> 99,092 distinct, `pad_id=2`), per-layer
  primes and offsets — so the HF normalizer chain does NOT have to be reimplemented. Verified:
  the 24 primes of L1 sum to 384,006,168 and L14 to 384,016,682, exactly the tensor `ne[1]`, and
  the multipliers reproduce bit-for-bit. Hash is `h = id0*m0`, then `h ^= idj*mj` for j=1..3,
  `row = h % prime[col] + offset[col]`. Bit-exact or garbage; no multi-probe, no collision handling.
- [ ] **DS41-B9 — Residency.** antirez `munmap`s the engram region after load
  (`ds4.c:2761-2796`) and `pread`s each 264-byte row through a separate fd, 16 concurrent readers,
  sorted and deduped, no LRU. Our v10 already auto-registers tensors >4 GiB as lazy mmap ranges
  with `POSIX_MADV_RANDOM` and suppresses `MAP_POPULATE` — **test that first**, it may approximate
  the same behaviour for free. Never with `--mlock`, `--no-mmap` or `--direct-io`. With 1.1 TB RAM,
  fully resident is also viable; measure page-fault cost per decode step either way.
- [ ] **DS41-B10 — KV-key adapter + arch delta.** The artifact's ~67 KV keys are **raw HF config
  names** (`deepseek41.hidden_size`, `.num_hidden_layers`, `.sliding_window`, `.hc_mult`, …), not
  llama.cpp canonical, so load fails in generic `load_hparams` before any V4.1 code runs. Map them;
  convert `scoring_func` string -> our `expert_gating_func` enum; accept `compress_ratios` {0,1,2}
  (today the loader throws on anything but {0,4,128}); supply `hash_layer_count=0`. Subclass
  `deepseek4`: make `output_hc_*`, `ffn_gate_tid2eid`, `nextn.*`, `attn_compressor_ape` and
  `indexer_compressor_*` non-required, move compressor/indexer creation to the *source-layer* sets,
  wire `indexer.attn_k`/`k_norm`, ignore `exp_probs_b_vl.bias`. Note `general.alignment = 16384`.
- [ ] **DS41-B11 — RoPE and norm deltas.** RoPE covers only the last 64 of 512 dims as
  **interleaved adjacent pairs** (not NeoX half-split), and the **inverse rotation is applied to the
  attention output** because the cache holds one shared rotated latent; YaRN applies only on
  compressed layers at `compress_rope_theta=160000`, pure-SWA layers use theta=10000 with YaRN off.
  `rms_norm_eps=1e-20`, and the top-k normalization hardcodes 1e-20 rather than norm_eps.
- [ ] **DS41-B12 — Three unresolved graph divergences** (answerable only by reading `ds4.c`'s V4.1
  graph against `src/models/deepseek4.cpp`, do this first in B1): (a) the artifact has **no
  `output_hc_*`**, so how V4.1 collapses the 4 hyper-connection streams at the head is unspecified
  by the weights; (b) `attn_compressor_gate` exists on layers {2,8,14} but **not on layer 20**
  (ratio 1), so layer 20's compressor is an ungated projection; (c) ratios 1/2 vs our 4/128 change
  the pooling factor and therefore the DSv4 cache geometry.
- [ ] **DS41-B13 — DSpark drafter (the spec-dec path), separately.** DSpark **does exist for this
  model**: the official checkpoint ships 2,401 `mtp.*` tensors in shards 44-46 (~8 GB) and
  `inference/model.py:1032-1156` implements it — a 3-block draft transformer over a **5-token
  block, bidirectional in-block**, own 128-expert/top-3 MoE, rank-256 Markov bias and a confidence
  head, embed/head tied to the backbone, fed by the hc-mean of the attention input at layers
  37-39. antirez neither ships nor implements it (`docs/MODELS.md:50`), and vcruz strips it, so
  **our artifact has no drafter**. Cheap fix: fetch only shards 44-46 and convert them into a
  separate draft GGUF; no 510 GB re-download. **The accept/verify loop does not exist even in the
  reference** (`generate.py` never calls `forward_spec`) — we would write it. Our `graph_mtp`
  asserts `n_layer_nextn == 1` and is the wrong axis (sequential depth, not block-parallel);
  `LLM_ARCH_DFLASH` is the closer template.
- [ ] **DS41-B14 — Rollback is value-level, not a position rewind.** Every cache here is
  destructively mutated: the 128-slot window ring for all blocks, the compressor's fixed-size
  `kv_state`/`score_state` accumulators on the 4 kv-source layers, the compressed-KV and indexer
  row writes that fire only when a group completes, and the n-gram hash state. The accumulators
  cannot be undone by rewinding a counter — the pre-step slot values must be saved. A naive port of
  `llama_kv_cache_seq_rm` corrupts them silently. This is the precondition for DS41-T4.

### T — Gates (translated from INF-69 T0-T4 / T0-SPEC / T15)

- [ ] DS41-T1 — Load plus short-context coherence smoke on CPU with the canonical env (abort on
  repetition loops). Record `(arch, index_topk, candidate settings, window)` from the load log.
- [ ] DS41-T2 — Sparse-attention disposition: dense-mask vs sparse gather, and a top-k /
  candidate-block cap semantics probe **before** any quality run (findings 1-2). Correctness
  findings also update INF-31.
- [ ] DS41-T3a — **Prompt-rendering parity is available today**: `encoding/encoding.py` is a
  pure-stdlib renderer with 5 byte-exact goldens, and `tokenizer_config.json` has **no
  chat_template**, so `encoding.py` is the only normative prompt spec — any llama.cpp template is a
  fresh re-derivation. DSML tool tags are space-prefixed (`" calls"`, `" invoke"`, `" parameter"`),
  which is the V4->V4.1 delta. Gaps: the goldens cover 5 of ~10 paths, 4 of 5 end in EOS, and
  double-BOS against llama.cpp's own BOS handling is unverified. **The official harness is NOT a
  usable parity instrument**: it is a TypeScript agent framework speaking the Anthropic Messages
  protocol, needing Docker and external DeepSWE task images; llama-server's OpenAI endpoint cannot
  serve it without a provider-adapter patch.
- [ ] DS41-T3 — **Reference parity**: logits/top-k tokens vs the official `inference/` reference
  on a manageable fixture (the FP8 reference cannot run full-size on this host; use a layer-
  truncated or per-op comparison), plus the V4 quality-gate runner/comparator
  (`epyc-inference-research/scripts/benchmark/v4_quality_gate_{runner,compare}.py`). Run the
  `deepseek-harness` evaluation path (`evaluation/dsh-minimal.patch`) as the model-native task
  harness. Separate quantization drift (Q4_K experts vs FP4/FP8 source) from port defects.
- [ ] DS41-T4 — **MTP exact rollback/replay**: forced rejection at every draft position; all
  accepted, none accepted, repeated cycles; rollback continuation vs replay of the accepted
  prefix; full vs chunked prefill; state save/restore; both KV-shared and index-shared layers.
- [ ] DS41-T5 — **Full-model trajectory gates**: plain vs MTP exact parity over the
  multi-prompt set (GLM precedent was 31 pairs), with real draft rejection witnessed. Measure
  depths 1/2/3 separately; depth parity does not generalize.
- [ ] DS41-T6 — Throughput baseline at the canonical CPU recipe (interleave, no-mmap, t48/t64,
  r5), plain vs native MTP, prefill and decode separated. Observation-grade first.
- [ ] DS41-T7 — GPU (MI210) path. The 483 GiB model cannot be VRAM-resident, so scope what can
  (hybrid offload of attention/shared/MTP) and measure it with proven residency.
- [ ] DS41-T8 — **Performance admission vs champion** (**acceleration-path caveat**: if the
  experts land as MXFP4, they are served by CPU_REPACK's AVX2 `mxfp4_8x8_q8_0` GEMM and **not** by
  iqk — `iqk_typeA_supported` excludes MXFP4/NVFP4 — so a comparison against a Q4_K MoE baseline
  compares two different acceleration paths, and the INF-70 iqk work the rest of the fleet relies
  on does not apply. NVFP4 cannot even be produced here: `llama-quant.cpp` throws on that ftype.): run the cross-model CPU and HIP
  regression on the full candidate before any champion fold. GLM's core passed its own gates but
  held a −25.71% Flash-Next CPU signal. AutoKernel gets a pointer only after this passes (see D).
- [ ] DS41-T9 — Role/quality fit per the standard suites; GO / WAIT / KILL disposition with the
  disk-retention decision (~483 GiB in the novel-under-test keep bucket until this verdict).

### D — Downstream

- [ ] DS41-D1 — AutoKernel source handoff (`docs/reference/models/deepseek41-autokernel-handoff.md`)
  on the GLM-5.3 template: exact branch/commit, build and launch recipe, mandatory MTP gates, and
  the objective (MTP-on output tok/s under exact trajectories).
- [ ] DS41-D2 — Wire the belief kernel: add the `deepseek41` validation/serving producer row to
  `scripts/vidya/adapters/README.md` and complete VB-DSV41 **before the first measured run**
  (DS41-T1). Project through `claim_tuple.grade()`; categorical parity verdicts stay categorical.

## Not carried over from INF-69 (GLM-only)

- **KDA recurrent attention and conv-state rollback** — V4.1 has no linear/recurrent attention layers.
- **`kpool` pooled-key semantics** — GLM-specific; the V4.1 analogue (compressor plus 8-token
  candidate blocks) is re-derived under DS41-T2, not inherited.
- **GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2 drafter** — deleted, and GLM-specific. V4.1 uses native MTP. The config's
  `dspark_*` weights DO ship, under `mtp.*` — see DS41-B7.
- **T5-T14 GLM kernel experiments** (Q8 prefill, expert multirow, batched Q8, CPY outer rows) —
  measured on GLM shapes; the results live in the GLM docs. Re-test only on V4.1 profile evidence.
- **`glm5next`/`glm5-next` alias compatibility** — GLM naming.
- *mHC is **not** dropped*: V4.1's `hc_*` hyper-connections are the same family and are covered by DS41-B4.

## Constraints

### Kernel work rides the champion (operator directive, 2026-09-23)

*"If any custom kernel work is required, make it part of an autokernel champion."* So the port
splits in two, by where the code lives and how it is proven:

| Layer | Where it lives | How it is proven |
|---|---|---|
| Model/graph: arch registration, loader, KV-key adapter, compress-ratio and RoPE deltas, DSpark graph | `experimental/deepseek41-port-20260923` only | DS41-T gates (parity, MTP, coherence) |
| **Custom kernels**: the Engram I8/E4M3-row gather + dequant (DS41-B7), and any GEMM/quant work the port turns out to need | authored as **model-agnostic ggml commits** and folded into the AutoKernel champion `ak/champion/llama-cpp-<frozen-short>` | AutoKernel measurement against the champion's current headline, then folded in and the headline re-measured |

Rules that follow:
- A kernel commit must not depend on `deepseek41` symbols. The Engram op is a **generic I8 row
  gather with an E4M3+E8M0 264-byte row layout**, usable by any model that adopts that layout.
- Base every kernel lever on the **current champion tip**, never on this port branch and never on
  pristine upstream; measure against the champion's current headline, fold in on validation, and
  re-measure the headline immediately. Production promotion stays separately operator-gated.
- The port branch **rebases onto the champion** whenever the champion moves, so the port never
  accumulates on a stale tip (the INC-20260706 rule).
- Consequence for the schedule: DS41-B7 is an AutoKernel deliverable with its own keep gate, not an
  inline patch in the port branch. Its acceleration-path caveat is in DS41-T8.
- This also puts the 28 GLM-5.3 keeps on the same track: DS41-K1 admits them into the champion, and
  the port inherits them by rebasing, rather than by carrying a second branch.

- Production kernels are frozen; all work goes on `llama.cpp-experimental` branches. The
  `llama.cpp-deepseek-v4` tree (antirez's V4 fork) is reference only.
- Experimental inference runs under held physical CPU-region claims; host-health caveats stay explicit.
- Do NOT add a `model_registry.yaml` role without operator approval.
- Every launcher sets its own `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and proves linkage (three ggml generations on host).
