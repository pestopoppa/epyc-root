# Autopilot Sequential Verdicts — the allocation rule, not the effect, was the binding constraint

**Status**: active — offline re-adjudication COMPLETE 2026-07-28 (zero inference); two candidates sit
within ~10 trials of a genuine confirm
**Created**: 2026-07-28
**Priority**: HIGH — this determines whether the benchmark-Autopilot program was ever tested
**Categories**: benchmark_methodology, autonomous_research, routing_intelligence
**Parent index**: [research-evaluation-index.md](research-evaluation-index.md)
**Related**: [episodic-memory-integrity.md](episodic-memory-integrity.md) (separate store — the reseed
did not touch the journal)

## The finding

Measured over **393 sequential trials / 141 candidates** in `orchestration/autopilot_journal*.jsonl`:

- **Median 1.0 trial per candidate** (mean 2.79, max 41). **90 of 141** candidate×era groups received
  exactly one trial.
- **0 of 121** refuted trials were killed by futility (`E <= futility_e = 0.05`). Every refutation
  came from the *budget* rule.
- The strongest candidate `70902e4b665474e7` trips `k>=8 and E<2.0` at k=8 with **E=1.68**, then
  climbs to **E_quality 11.55 by k=40 — while still labelled `refuted` the whole way.**

`confirm_e = 20.0` is the Ville bound for α=0.05 and is untouchable. **`budget = 8` and
`budget_min_e = 2.0` (`src/autopilot_core/sequential_verdict.py:44-57`) are a compute-allocation
heuristic with no bearing on anytime-validity.** Relaxing them is statistically free.

## Re-adjudication result (2026-07-28, zero inference)

`scripts/analysis/readjudicate_sequential_candidates.py` re-folds the recorded per-trial `z` values
through the project's own `rebuild_candidate_view`, era-fenced by `core_id`, with `budget` and
`budget_min_e` relaxed and every other policy parameter untouched.

```
candidates CONFIRMED under the relaxed budget:              0
recorded 'refuted' that are NOT refuted once budget drops:  9
candidates still RISING when the run ended:                58

candidate           core      k          E     grow   need  recorded
70902e4b665474e7    core_v1  40    11.5507   1.0631      9  refuted

db866b4a9fa37e03    core_v1  10     1.5856   1.0472     55  refuted
45129cc6ee5bac29    core_v1  12     1.5609   1.0378     69  refuted
```

**Verdict: the benchmark-Autopilot hypothesis is NOT falsified — it was never funded to a verdict.**
No candidate crosses `confirm_e` on evidence already purchased, but two are close and were still
rising steeply when cut.

**Caveat, stated plainly**: `need` is an *extrapolation* from the observed per-trial growth factor. It
assumes the effect persists at the same rate, which the data cannot guarantee — an e-process can
plateau or reverse. Treat it as a cost estimate for the next experiment, never as a predicted
outcome.

## Two defects in the verdict machinery

- [ ] **SEQ-A — the `refuted` label is STICKY.** `state_name()`
      (`sequential_verdict.py:131-138`) is a pure function of current state, so a candidate that
      outgrows the kill condition should read `accumulating` again. It does not: **56 of 393 trials
      carry `state="refuted"` while `E >= budget_min_e` and `k >= budget`** — the persisted label
      contradicts what the policy's own function returns for that very trial. `70902e4b665474e7`
      crosses E=2.0 at k=10 and stays labelled refuted to k=40 at E=11.55. Decide: recompute the
      label per trial, or make stickiness explicit and documented.
- [ ] **SEQ-B — the baseline-promotion gate is unreachable.** Max `baseline_promotion_combined_E`
      ever observed is **1.0795** against `required_E = 100.0`, and `combined_E == E_rate_noninf`
      exactly in **307 of 391** trials — the rate e-process dominates and is effectively frozen. No
      candidate can be promoted through this gate regardless of quality evidence. Fix before any new
      campaign, or the compute burns into a gate that cannot open.

## Tasks

- [x] SEQ-1 — Verify the k=8/allocation claims directly against the journal. ✅ 2026-07-28
- [x] SEQ-2 — Build and run the offline re-adjudication (zero inference). ✅ 2026-07-28
      Report: `orchestration/reports/readjudicate_sequential_20260728.json`
- [ ] SEQ-3 — **Decide the allocation policy.** The cheapest decisive experiment is ~9-10 more trials
      on `70902e4b665474e7` (≈2.6 eval-hours at the historical ~935 s/trial) to see whether it
      actually crosses E=20. That is the first confirmed-or-refuted verdict the program would ever
      have produced. Inference-gated.
- [ ] SEQ-A — Sticky `refuted` label (above).
- [ ] SEQ-B — Frozen baseline-promotion gate (above).
- [ ] SEQ-4 — Re-examine the 9 candidates whose refutation does not survive the relaxed budget.
      They were removed from consideration by an allocation heuristic, not by evidence.

## Why this is independent of the episodic-memory work

The candidate evidence lives in `orchestration/autopilot_journal*.jsonl`, a different store from
`orchestration/repl_memory/sessions/`. Journal mtimes (2026-06-27, 2026-07-27T08:23) predate the
2026-07-27T22:07 reseed, and `rebuild_candidate_view` folds *journal-derived* z sequences. **Scrubbing
and reseeding episodic memory cost this analysis nothing.**

## Reporting

Record SEQ-3's outcome here with the trial count actually spent and the final E. If the candidate
crosses 20.0, the program has its first genuine confirm and the allocation rule should be
re-specified. If it plateaus, that is equally decision-grade — and far cheaper than the ~347
eval-hours already spent without a verdict.
