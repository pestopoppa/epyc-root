# Session Bus + Thin Dispatcher — N-main-thread control structure

**Status**: DESIGN-RATIFIED (operator, 2026-07-27, plan-mode Q&A ×2) — build-ready; M1 skeleton is verbatim below
**Created**: 2026-07-27
**Priority**: HIGH — removes the operator-paste-buffer relay bottleneck measured all week
**Effort**: M1–M2 ~half day · M3–M4 ~1–2 days (incl. the 48h M4 soak) · M5 optional, flag-gated
**Categories**: coordination, governance, automation
**Parent index**: [master-handoff-index.md](master-handoff-index.md) (★ post-closure pivot block)
**Related**: [`../../coordination/inference-batch/LOOP_PROTOCOL.md`](../../coordination/inference-batch/LOOP_PROTOCOL.md) (contracts this extends) · [`../../coordination/inference-batch/op-bundle.md`](../../coordination/inference-batch/op-bundle.md) (token-queue pattern) · [heterogeneous-slot-fabric-residency.md](heterogeneous-slot-fabric-residency.md) + the ratified fabric contract (convergence target) · CLAUDE.md §Long-horizon throughput contract + `agents/shared/MEASUREMENT_POLICY.md` §Consolidated apply-time ratification (the policies this mechanizes)

---

## Executor start here

Zero inference throughout. Build **M1 verbatim from §Skeleton** (files + schema + CLI), run the
M1 manual round-trip acceptance, then M2→M4 in order. Every M5 item is independently
flag/grant-gated — do not build any of them until its gate is granted. The dispatcher NEVER
analyzes, reviews, or edits work products — queue/routing/watchdog only ("the moment it
reviews, it's a second main" — operator).

## Why

- The operator ran multiple agent main-threads (Codex long-horizon, Claude oversight, others)
  coordinated **through their own paste buffer** — relay latency, false serialization (bench
  work gated behind unrelated token chains), and idle hardware during governance turns.
- Now-binding policies this structure mechanizes: zero-idle compute + saturation scheduling +
  boundary-tokens-only-while-saturated (CLAUDE.md `401f4a36`), consolidated apply-time
  ratification + pre-validated operator commands (`MEASUREMENT_POLICY.md`), run-first bias.
- Operator decisions (2026-07-27): build now at N=2 mains but **roster-driven N-main from day
  one**; **hybrid runtime** (deterministic core + capped one-shot triage); Codex consumption
  via boundary drain (send-keys OFF behind grant); operator interface = a **meta-main** agent
  thread; authority matrix below.

## Components

| Component | Runs where | Cloned from |
|---|---|---|
| **Session bus** (files) | `coordination/session-bus/` | `coordination/inference-batch/` (ledger + op-bundle) |
| **Dispatcher daemon** `session_bus_dispatcher.py` | host, nohup+flock (or tmux window in session `agent`) — NOT inside any agent session | `hub_supervisor.sh` loop discipline + `batch_ledger.py` fold |
| **Bus library/CLI** `scripts/coordination/session_bus.py` | called by dispatcher AND agents | `batch_ledger.py` / `batch_status_report.py` |
| **Watchdog-of-dispatcher** `scripts/coordination/bus_supervisor.sh` | host, nohup+flock | verbatim `hub_supervisor.sh` clone (health = dispatcher heartbeat mtime) |
| **Meta-main** (operator-facing coordination agent) | an agent session (today: the Claude oversight session, formalized) | the role this week's session performed ad hoc |
| **Hub visibility** `/api/bus`, `/api/queue`, `/bus` page | `dashboard/server.py` (:8100) | `/api/kernel` external-contract pattern |
| **Triage hook** (M5, flag-gated) | dispatcher subprocess, one-shot `claude -p --model haiku` via `claude_via_devc.sh` | nightshift budget caps |
| **Codex nudge adapter** (M5, grant-gated OFF) | dispatcher → `tmux send-keys -t agent` | new, deliberately tiny |

**Meta-main** (operator decision Q3): a first-class bus participant (roster role `meta-main`,
own inbox/outbox/heartbeat/cursor) responsible for parallel-thread coordination — presents
token requests + decision packages to the operator, relays operator intent onto the bus,
monitors/audits mains, handles all unstructured coordination the deterministic dispatcher
cannot. `tokens/token-queue.md` stays the durable substrate; meta-main is its presenter.
FUTURE seam (explicitly out of scope now): expose the meta-main thread as a dedicated
phone-accessible chat.

**Deployment note**: the dispatcher needs host visibility (`inference_load_check.py`,
`rocm-smi`, pgrep, optionally the host tmux server) — run it host-side like
`hub_supervisor.sh`. Repo paths are the shared mount, so container agents read/write the same
bus files.

## File layout

```
coordination/session-bus/
  BUS_PROTOCOL.md              # single-writer + claim + ack contract (LOOP_PROTOCOL analog)
  config.yaml                  # roster (N mains + meta-main), lanes, authority matrix,
                               # thresholds, flags (codex_sendkeys: off, triage: off), caps
  config/routing-table.yaml    # task-class → (main, model-tier, effort) data artifact
  session_bus.schema.json      # Draft-07 schema: msg + queue rows
  queue.jsonl                  # WORK QUEUE — single writer: DISPATCHER
  inbox/<agent>.jsonl          # single writer: dispatcher
  outbox/<agent>.jsonl         # single writer: that agent
  tokens/token-queue.md        # op-bundle clone; agents author blocks, dispatcher relays,
                               # meta-main presents, operator flips [x] GRANTED <date>
  heartbeats/<agent>.json      # atomic overwrite (tmp+rename), one file per writer
  cursors/<agent>.json         # per-consumer read offsets (byte offset per inbox file)
  archive/                     # rotation, dispatcher-owned files only, only past all cursors
```

Single-writer is **structural**: one writer may own many files; no file has two writers.
**Adding a main = 1 roster row + 4 files** (inbox/outbox/heartbeat/cursor). Codex and
claude-main are merely the first two roster entries (operator: N-main is routine, not future).

## Schemas

### `session_bus.msg.v1` (all bus jsonl)
`schema_version, id ("msg-<ts>-<seq>-<writer>", sortable), ts, from, to` (roster ids or `*`),
`kind ∈ {task-assign, task-complete, status, finding, decision-request, token-request, ack,
nudge, defect, requeue, reprioritize, saturation}`, `corr_id, task_id, requires_ack,
ack_deadline_s, priority, payload` (kind-specific, schema-validated).
Key payloads:
- `task-assign`: `{spec_ref|inline_spec, lane, lease_expires_ts, epoch}`
- `token-request`: `{gate_id, block_ref, validated: {cmd, dry_run_exit, dry_run_evidence}}` —
  **pre-validation mandatory**; an operator command that fails ⇒ `defect` row attributed to
  the requesting agent (policy).
- `decision-request`: full pre-formed Gate/Evidence/Options A–C/Recommendation block authored
  by the **agent**; dispatcher relays verbatim.
- `reprioritize`: `{task_id, new_priority, scope}` — validated against the authority matrix;
  unauthorized ⇒ rejected + `defect` row.

### `session_bus.queue.v1` (`queue.jsonl`; latest-row-per-task_id-wins fold, = `batch_ledger.reconcile`)
`batch_ledger.v2` fields plus: `lane ∈ {cpu, gpu, none}` (none = code/doc work, always
schedulable), `contention_class` (reuses quiet-window semantics), `origin, status ∈ {READY,
ASSIGNED, CLAIMED, RUNNING, DONE_PASS, DONE_MARGINAL_OBS, FAILED, INFRA_BLOCKED, HELD_OP_GATE,
STALE_REQUEUED, CANCELLED}`, `depends_on[], operator_gates[], priority, est_wall_clock_h,
owner, assign_msg_id, epoch` (dispatcher generation counter, fencing), `claim_ts,
lease_expires_ts, heartbeat_grace_s, attempt, max_attempts, spec_ref` (spec stays OUT of the
row), `findings[], artifacts[], era_stamp, failure_reason, routing_annotation` (from triage,
advisory only).
**Agents never write `queue.jsonl`**: they propose (outbox `finding`/task-propose) and report
(`ack`/`status`/`task-complete`); the dispatcher transcribes — pure bookkeeping, no judgment.

### Heartbeat file
`{agent, ts, state: idle|working|draining, task_id|null, note}` — atomic overwrite.

## Protocols

### Task assignment (zero-idle path)
1. Dispatcher tick (30–60s): fold queue + outboxes; lane snapshot (`classify_load()` +
   `mi210_state()` + heartbeats — a lane is idle only when ALL agree; fail-safe unknown=busy).
2. For each agent with no live CLAIMED/RUNNING task and <1 pending ASSIGNED (one-task
   lookahead): eligible = `READY ∧ depends_on terminal ∧ operator_gates GRANTED ∧ lane matches
   roster ∧ contention_class compatible with load class`; pick by priority (then
   stack-affinity, per pick-next-entry), consuming `routing_annotation` if present.
3. Append queue row `{ASSIGNED, owner, epoch, lease_expires_ts}` + inbox `task-assign`
   (requires_ack).
4. Agent drains inbox at its boundary (Codex: session-init/task boundary per the standing
   CLAUDE.md instruction added in M1; Claude mains: Monitor push or M5 Stop-hook) → outbox
   `ack` then `status RUNNING`.
5. Dispatcher folds ack → CLAIMED → RUNNING rows. On `task-complete` → terminal row → next
   assignment. Lookahead means the agent's next boundary-poll already finds work — no idle gap.

### Decision-request → operator token (via meta-main)
1. Agent hits a trust boundary → authors the FULL pre-formed block with the operator command
   **pre-validated** (dry-run evidence attached) → outbox `token-request` → agent CONTINUES
   with other eligible work (never blocks).
2. Dispatcher relays the block verbatim into `tokens/token-queue.md`; gated tasks →
   `HELD_OP_GATE`.
3. **Presentation rule (saturation-gated)**: meta-main presents pending tokens to the operator
   only while the saturation snapshot shows lanes busy — EXCEPT when a gate is the sole cause
   of imminent lane idleness, which forces immediate presentation.
4. Operator flips `[ ] → [x] GRANTED <date>`; next tick re-admits gated tasks.

### Stall ladder
- **soft-stall** (no outbox activity + stale heartbeat past lane-tuned grace; cpu/gpu grace
  derives from `est_wall_clock_h` — silence ≠ stall on bench lanes): inbox `nudge`
  (+ send-keys IF granted, rate-limited, idle-pane-checked).
- **hard-stall** (lease expired): `STALE_REQUEUED` (owner cleared, attempt+1) + `defect` row;
  task returns to READY for any capable main.
- **give-up** (attempts exhausted / heartbeat dead through ladder): alert block in
  token-queue + hub health red — operator/meta-main decision, never the dispatcher's.
- **dispatcher-stall**: `bus_supervisor.sh` restarts with backoff; hub classifies dispatcher
  heartbeat staleness.

## Authority matrix (config.yaml; deterministically enforced)

| Actor | Within own lane | Cross-main |
|---|---|---|
| main | reprioritize own-lane rows ✔ | ✘ (rejected + defect row) |
| meta-main | ✔ | ✔ (reprioritize any; direct a main to reprioritize) |
| operator | ✔ | ✔ (via token-queue or meta-main) |
| dispatcher | never sets priorities — only transcribes/validates | — |

## Failure modes designed out

Dispatcher dies → supervisor restart, agents degrade to no-new-assignments, files can't
corrupt. Split-brain → flock singleton + **epoch fencing** (restart increments epoch; stale
assigns ignored/flagged) + dispatcher-only queue writes. Stale rows → leases +
STALE_REQUEUED + status-report flags. Message loss → append-only + requires_ack + redelivery
(same corr_id, consumer dedupe by id) + rotation only past all cursors. Codex ignoring inbox →
nudge ladder → (granted) send-keys → token-queue surfacing; hard-stalled tasks requeue to
other mains. Runaway spawn → config caps (`max_headless_workers`, `max_spawns_per_day`,
per-task wall budget) checked before any exec.

## Hybrid triage (operator decision Q1 — M5, flag-gated, budget-capped)

One-shot smallest-model subprocess (`claude -p --model haiku` via `claude_via_devc.sh`),
never resident, two duties ONLY:
1. **Dead-agent block drafting**: when an agent dies without authoring its decision block,
   draft one from log tails — output always marked `DRAFT-UNREVIEWED`.
2. **Task→tier routing annotation**: classify inbound task proposals against
   `config/routing-table.yaml` (task-class → main, model-tier, effort) and write an advisory
   `routing_annotation`. The table is **policy-as-data**: seeded manually from
   `feedback_subagent_model_effort_matching`; future: rebuilt from benchmarked episodic
   routing memory (the operator's original claude-tier task-benchmark concept, revived as a
   data artifact). Triage never assigns; the deterministic rule consumes annotations.
Bright line: the triage hook never reads or evaluates work products.

## Convergence with the orchestration stack (operator-requested)

| Orchestration stack | Session bus | Note |
|---|---|---|
| frontdoor + learned router | dispatcher assignment + routing-table.yaml | both: routing = compiled policy-data; intelligence in endpoints |
| placement queue + contention matrix | lane sensing + saturation scheduler | bus reuses `classify_load` semantics read-only |
| slot leases (WP-12 fabric) | task claims + leases + epoch fencing | |
| op-bundle operator gates | tokens/token-queue.md | same grant lifecycle |
| model backends (fungible within role) | agent mains (**stateful — NOT fungible**) | requeue is lossy; leases tuned accordingly |

Fabric-contract consistency: the bus is pure policy-as-data (files/YAML/JSONL) — satisfies
*policy-data-never-code* by construction. Roster rows are **slot-shaped**
(`{id, role, lanes, capabilities, endpoint}`) so a future local-model main (hermes/opencode
agent served by the orchestrator) is just another row. **Defer triggers for unification**:
(a) a local-model long-horizon main exists, or (b) the slot fabric lands "everything is a
slot". Until then the ONLY stack contact is read-only sensing via `inference_load_check.py`.

## Skeleton (M1 — write these verbatim, then adapt)

**Directories**: `coordination/session-bus/{inbox,outbox,tokens,heartbeats,cursors,archive,config}/`

**`BUS_PROTOCOL.md`** (draft body):
```
# Session Bus Protocol v1
1. SINGLE WRITER: queue.jsonl + inbox/* = dispatcher; outbox/<a> = agent <a>;
   heartbeats/<w> = writer <w>; tokens/token-queue.md blocks = dispatcher relay,
   checkboxes = operator. No file ever has two writers.
2. NEVER BLOCK: no agent waits on the bus; work continues; grants/acks are picked
   up at the next boundary (op-bundle contract).
3. ACKS: requires_ack messages are redelivered as nudge (same corr_id) after
   ack_deadline_s; consumers dedupe by msg id.
4. CURSORS: each consumer owns cursors/<self>.json (byte offsets); never rewind
   another's cursor. Rotation (dispatcher, own files only) only past ALL cursors,
   into archive/.
5. AUTHORITY: reprioritize scope per config.yaml matrix; violations are rejected
   with a defect row.
6. Trust boundaries unchanged: era rows, MEASUREMENT.md, baseline applies,
   production freezes, host reboots are HUMAN-ONLY. The dispatcher sequences and
   the meta-main presents; neither signs.
```

**`config.yaml`** (seed):
```yaml
schema_version: session_bus.config.v1
roster:
  - {id: codex,       role: main,      lanes: [cpu, gpu, none], endpoint: tmux:agent,   drain: boundary}
  - {id: claude-main, role: main,      lanes: [cpu, gpu, none], endpoint: monitor:file, drain: push}
  - {id: meta-main,   role: meta-main, lanes: [none],           endpoint: monitor:file, drain: push}

```

**`session_bus.py` CLI surface** (clone fold semantics from `batch_ledger.py`):
`append` (schema-validated row → owned file) · `fold` (queue/outbox reconcile,
latest-per-task_id) · `validate` (whole-bus schema + single-writer lint) · `cursor`
(get/advance own cursor) · `status` (human summary: queue by status/lane, inbox depths,
heartbeat ages) · `drain` (print own inbox past cursor + advance; the one-liner agents run
at boundaries).

**M1 also includes**: the CLAUDE.md standing instruction (one line, near the throughput
contract): *"Bus drain: at every task boundary, run `session_bus.py drain --agent <id>` and
act on assignments/nudges; write acks/status to your outbox."* (Codex inherits via AGENTS.md
symlink — this IS the Q2 resolution; M1's acceptance validates it empirically.)

## Milestones

- [ ] **M1 — skeleton + manual round-trip.** Write §Skeleton verbatim; add the CLAUDE.md
  drain instruction; both current mains + meta-main adopt outbox/inbox manually (operator or
  meta-main plays dispatcher by hand). Accept: one task READY→ASSIGNED→CLAIMED→RUNNING→
  DONE_PASS across two real sessions via file appends only; every row schema-valid;
  single-writer audit clean (git blame per file = one authoring session); **Codex drains its
  inbox at a real boundary unprompted**. Rollback: delete directory.
- [ ] **M2 — hub visibility.** `/api/bus` + `/api/queue` (clone `/api/kernel` payload-builder
  + `freshness.classify` on semantic `generated_at`), `/bus` page (queue table, inbox depths,
  heartbeat ages, pending tokens). Accept: renders live state; correct staleness classes on a
  stale fixture; fails soft. Rollback: revert additive routes.
- [ ] **M3 — dispatcher daemon, read-only advisory.** `session_bus_dispatcher.py` (flock,
  tick loop, heartbeat, epoch) emitting advisory `saturation` + would-assign rows only;
  `bus_supervisor.sh`. Accept: would-assign matches actual human/agent choices over a working
  day (divergences explainable); survives kill -9 via supervisor; zero writes to foreign
  files. Rollback: stop daemon (bus stays in M1 manual mode).
- [ ] **M4 — assignment authority.** Real task-assign + lease/stall ladder + requeue + token
  relay; mains consume assignments at boundaries. Accept: 48h with zero idle-lane time while
  eligible work existed (hub saturation history is the evidence); one induced stall exercises
  nudge→requeue; induced dispatcher restart mid-assignment shows epoch fencing (no double
  assignment); operator touched ONLY token-queue checkboxes. Rollback: `authority: advisory`.
- [ ] **M5 — flag-gated extensions** (each independent): Claude Stop/SessionStart drain hook
  (clone `*_context.sh`) · send-keys adapter behind `OP-SENDKEYS-CODEX` (OFF; rate-limited;
  idle-pane check) · hybrid triage (dead-agent drafts + routing annotations; budget-capped;
  `DRAFT-UNREVIEWED`) · headless workers via `claude_via_devc.sh` under caps. Accept: per
  feature as specced. Rollback: per-flag disable.

## Decision gates

- `OP-SENDKEYS-CODEX` (send-keys nudging) — operator grant, evidence-driven, default OFF.
- `triage: on` + `triage_calls_per_day` — operator flag after M4 soak.
- Headless-worker caps >0 — operator, only after M4 acceptance.
- M4 go/no-go rests on M3's advisory-accuracy evidence.
