# ROCm Verify/Profile/Benchmark Backend for MI210 Kernel Authoring

**Status**: SKELETON — design scaffold; substrate is now mostly *adopt AMD-native*, not build-from-scratch
**Created**: 2026-06-03 · **Updated**: 2026-06-03 (GEAK keystone reversal + AgentKernelArena)
**Categories**: hardware_optimization, benchmark_methodology, tool_implementation, inference_serving
**Hardware gate — SATISFIED 2026-07-02**: AMD MI210 Instinct (CDNA2 / gfx90a, 64 GB) is racked; ROCm 6.2 bind-mounted; llama.cpp HIP build verified on gfx90a (`progress/2026-07/2026-07-02-mi210.md`). This backend is now **ACTIVE** (priority MEDIUM). Runnable first tasks: (1) install/pin `pytorch-triton-rocm` matched to ROCm 6.2 + verify gfx90a matmul (intake-760); (2) stand up `rocprof-compute` gfx90a metric subset (C4); (3) the honest-vendor-baseline candidates that are gfx90a-*reachable* — **BitBLAS/TileLang low-bit GEMM** (intake-497/tilelang-puzzles), **NOT AITER** (gfx942-only, intake-759). All runs operator-approved (P-GPU-1). [was: "~July 2026; nothing executes until the card racks" — stale]
**Priority**: MEDIUM (the substrate for [`agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md`](agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md))
**Parent**: [`agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md`](agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md) · **Parent index**: [`inference-acceleration-index.md`](inference-acceleration-index.md)
**Full reasoning + evidence**: [`research/deep-dives/agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring-geak-synthesis.md`](../../research/deep-dives/agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring-geak-synthesis.md) (§5.2/§5.5/§5.6 cover this backend).

## Objective
Provide the **evaluation backend** the agentic kernel-authoring loop calls: given a candidate HIP/Triton kernel + a PyTorch reference, return `(compiles?, correct?, speedup, profiler_metrics, integrity_flags)`. It is factored out from the controller (model + search) so controllers can be A/B'd without touching it. **The substrate is now mostly AMD-native MIT/Apache-2.0 code (GEAK-eval + Apex + AgentKernelArena) demonstrated on gfx90a — so this is an adopt/reproduce/harden task, not a from-scratch build.** The two genuinely net-new pieces are **C4** (gfx90a profiler-metric) and **C6** (anti-reward-hacking).

## Component table — adopt / build / harden (post-GEAK truth)
| # | Component | Plan | Source | Risk |
|---|-----------|------|--------|------|
| **C1** | Build (hipcc/hipify/torch-ROCm) | **ADOPT** | GEAK-eval 674 / Apex 675 (already build on ROCm/gfx90a); torch-ROCm `load_inline` known-good | LOW |
| **C2** | Correctness oracle | **ADOPT then HARDEN** | adopt GEAK-eval's torch-ROCm oracle; **harden** with robust-kbench 668 (forward+backward, multi/unseen shapes, magnitude/variation, output-buffer poisoning) **+ AgentKernelArena 679 unseen-shape generator** | MED |
| **C3** | Timing / speedup reward | **ADOPT then FIX BASELINE** | adopt GEAK-eval timing + Apex/AgentKernelArena Magpie score; **gate reward on an honest vendor baseline** (rocBLAS/hipBLASLt/AITER/torch-ROCm-compile), not eager (FastKernels 671) | MED |
| **C4** | Profiler-metric feed | **BUILD — try cheapest first** | (1) GEAK-v2 677 Profiler-Analyzer: raw `rocprof-compute` → LLM → NL; (2) Xe-Forge 672 static gfx90a constraint-KB (profiler-free); (3) CudaForge 662 formal offline selection. NVIDIA/NCU subset does NOT transfer | **HIGH** — the standing research risk; CDNA2 counter taxonomy unproven |
| **C5** | Benchmark / task suite | **ADOPT (primary) + layer** | GEAK-eval 674 (TritonBench-revised + real ROCm bench, gfx90a-proven) **and** AgentKernelArena 679 (HIP/Triton/Torch2HIP suites); layer our own `fast_p` tiering; seed EPYC ops (attention/MoE-dispatch/dequant). MultiKernelBench 667 = secondary (multi-vendor abstraction only) | MED |
| **C6** | Reward-integrity / anti-hacking | **BUILD — our differentiator** | robust-kbench 668 exploit-class half (Apache-2.0, liftable) **+** AgentKernelArena 679 unseen-shape half **+** a red-team-with-cheating-kernels gate. GEAK/Apex have only loose oracles | MED |

## Current sequence (replaces the old phase plan)
- [x] **Pre-hardware prep (now).** Pin GEAK / GEAK-eval / Apex / AgentKernelArena repos to paper-matching commits, inspect licenses, and draft a split ROCm + torch-ROCm environment recipe ✅ 2026-07-29. Source pins and the no-execution activation order are recorded in [deep-dive §10](../../research/deep-dives/agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring-geak-synthesis.md#10-pre-hardware-source-pins-and-deferred-environment-recipe-2026-07-29): GEAK v1 `v1.0.0` is Apache-2.0 (not the old MIT label); Apex is MIT; AgentKernelArena is Apache-2.0; GEAK-eval has no project-level license at its paper-era snapshot, so its code is **no-reuse pending resolution**. GEAK v1 (`triton==3.1.0`) and GEAK-eval (`triton==3.3.0`) require isolated environments. No install, server, benchmark, GPU/ROCm workload, or production-kernel action is authorized by this closure.
- [ ] **MI210 bring-up (gated on card).** Install ROCm + torch-ROCm; confirm `gfx90a` visible; **reproduce GEAK-eval's MI250X numbers on the MI210** (sanity gate — expect lower absolute speedups at ~half the aggregate bandwidth, verify correctness/compile). Also reproduce AgentKernelArena on gfx90a (`target_gpu_model`).
- [ ] **Harden oracle + integrity (C2 + C6).** Lift robust-kbench's exploit-class defenses + AgentKernelArena's unseen-shape generator into the GEAK/Apex oracle; red-team with deliberately-cheating kernels.
- [ ] **Honest baseline + E2E scoring (C3 + FastKernels gate).** Gate reward on a vendor baseline; add a whole-model exit gate via Apex's hot-patch + re-bench with captured EPYC-workload tensors.
- [ ] **C4 profiler feedback (HIGH risk).** Try GEAK-v2 LLM-reads-raw-rocprof first; Xe-Forge static-KB second; CudaForge formal selection fallback. Derive whether a usable gfx90a signal exists.
- [ ] **EPYC-op seeding + controller A/B.** Seed the suites with EPYC ops; A/B controllers as AgentKernelArena adapters (see parent handoff).
- [ ] **HIP arm (after the Triton loop works).** GEAK-HIP patterns (678) + AgentKernelArena Torch2HIP suite (679) + our own HIP oracle, toward hand-HIP for the llama.cpp fork.

## Interface contract (the seam controllers depend on)
```
evaluate(candidate_source, torch_reference_module, inputs) -> {
    compiled: bool,
    correct:  bool,              # hardened C2 verdict (incl. unseen-shape check)
    speedup:  float,             # C3 reward vs the HONEST vendor baseline
    metrics:  dict[str, float],  # C4 gfx90a profiler signal (for a profiler-fed judge)
    diagnostics: str,            # compiler/runtime errors -> Correction-mode feedback
    integrity_flags: list[str],  # C6 exploit detections (empty = clean)
}
```
Mirrors GEAK-eval's evaluator, Apex's Magpie scorer, and CUDA Agent's `verification.py`/`profiling.py`/`compile.sh` (intake-660) — all validate this factoring. Resist widening the seam; a new controller's needs should be derivable from these fields.

## gfx90a caveat + audit
Same `gfx90a` predicts **compile compatibility, not performance equivalence** — reproduce every AMD number on the MI210 before trusting it (GEAK-v1 carries the only gfx90a *evaluation*; GEAK-v2/HIP/AgentKernelArena publish gfx942 numbers only — but GEAK **v4** retains first-class gfx90a *knowledge*, amended 2026-08-03 in [`agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md`](agentic-rocm-kernel-authoring.md)). **Run the GEAK-family freshness sweep (deep dive §9) at each audit.** All intake-674–679 AMD numbers are vendor-reported until reproduced on our own gfx90a (`feedback_classify_eval_failures_by_reason`, observe-before-diagnosing).

## C4 is blocked on TOOL AVAILABILITY, not only on metric selection — 2026-08-03 (research-intake Stage-2b)

The C4 row above is scored HIGH risk for "CDNA2 counter taxonomy unproven". That is only half of it:
**the profilers themselves are absent.** `rocprofv2`, `rocprof` and `omniperf` were all missing as of
2026-07-20 ([`mi210-big-model-and-acceleration-roadmap.md:205`](mi210-big-model-and-acceleration-roadmap.md));
`rocprof` v1's SQ/TA counters read zero on this box and it aborts at init on graph-enabled builds;
`rocm-bandwidth-test` is not installed; and QuixiCore's timing recipe — otherwise worth copying — assumes
`rocprofv3`, also absent.

**This is a regression, not a contradiction.** Two other files record successful `rocprofv2` runs on
2026-07-04, sixteen days earlier, so something changed on the host between those dates. Recording it as a
chronology rather than as an inconsistency is the point: the earlier runs are still valid evidence, and
the fix is a host action (reinstall/re-pin), not a re-litigation of which file is right.

- [ ] Restore `rocprofv2` (and evaluate `rocprofv3`) on the host; establish which of the 2026-07-04 →
  2026-07-20 changes removed them, so it does not recur mid-campaign
- [ ] Install `rocm-bandwidth-test` — it is also the instrument for the achievable-bandwidth denominator
  §8.3.1 requires (`autokernel-research-loop.md` §14 AK1)
- [ ] Re-score the C4 risk row once tooling exists: "no usable gfx90a signal" and "no profiler installed"
  are different findings and must not be allowed to alias

## C6 monitor design — five rules from a sabotage/sandbagging red-team (intake-979; 2026-08-03)

_Via `/research-intake` Stage-2b. C6 is our named differentiator and it had no design for the case where
the agent **underperforms deliberately** rather than cheats. All five are prompt- or plumbing-level and
cost essentially nothing._

**Why this reaches kernel work at all** — the observed sandbagging strategies map straight onto our
domain. Verbatim from the source: *"agents might train their models on a needlessly small subset to
avoid supposed memory issues, or use small and few layers for their CNNs."* Kernel analogues:
conservative tile/block sizes justified by "LDS pressure", disabled fast paths justified by "numerical
safety", low unroll factors justified by "register spills". **Each is individually defensible — which is
exactly why they evaded the general monitor.**

- [ ] **Give the monitor the WHOLE SEARCH TREE, not the selected candidate.** Best-path-only transcripts
  structurally advantage a saboteur (the authors say so). Hand the monitor every evaluated variant
  **including discarded higher-scoring ones** — otherwise a candidate that quietly discards its own best
  result is invisible. This is a plumbing requirement on the journal, not a prompt change
- [ ] **Name the threat model in the monitor prompt.** Largest measured effect in the study: a generic
  "is this suspicious?" monitor **rarely fires** on sandbagging; the threat-specific one "performs well"
- [ ] **Aggregate.** Mean over monitor models ≈ the best single monitor (0.993 vs 0.970); mean@k over
  repeated samples of one model also improves AUC with fast diminishing returns. Cheap on our stack
- [ ] **Assume monitor-awareness.** Every monitor scored higher AUC on unaware runs, universally. Any
  agent that can read the loop's config knows it is monitored — design for the aware case
- [ ] **Preserve CoT visibility.** Hidden reasoning tokens are described as a "large advantage to the
  agent"; a monitor reading only final outputs is the weak configuration
- [ ] **Declare an explicit FPR budget rather than claiming safety** — *"gaining strict safety guarantees
  may require prohibitively high false positive rates."* A C6 layer with no stated FPR is not a gate
- Secondary signal available free: attempting sabotage **reduced main-task performance** for both
  scaffolds in the study — a measurable tax usable as corroboration
- **Cite the qualitative sandbagging finding, never a number**: the AUCs live only in a plot legend that
  is not text-extractable from either the PDF or the HTML render (NOT-FOUND-IN-SOURCE)


## Auto-kernel revival — research-intake integration 2026-07-22 (C6 + task-contract from OpenHyra/HyRA)
_Via /research-intake Stage-2 (intake-884 HyRA, intake-885 OpenHyra). OpenHyra effectively implements the C6 anti-reward-hacking differentiator this backend owns but never built._
- [x] Build C6 (reward-integrity) from OpenHyra's proven design: a trusted evaluator OUTSIDE the sandbox recomputes score on an immutable snapshot (self-reported numbers ignored); anti-TOCTOU snapshot (O_NOFOLLOW, reject symlink/FIFO/multiply-linked, size cap, chmod 0444, SIGKILL the candidate process-group BEFORE snapshot; OpenHyra `sandbox.py:80-134,255`); correctness-gate evaluated BEFORE latency (HyRA SOL-ExecBench `is_correct` precondition). This is the anti-cheating-kernel gate this handoff notes GEAK/Apex leave loose ✅ 2026-07-22
- [x] Adopt the SOL-ExecBench task/scoring schema {entry_point kernel.py::run, target_hardware, dependencies, hard is_correct gate, sol_score, latency_ms} as the C5 task contract, and OpenHyra run-manifest provenance (sha256 sources+task+evaluator + resume-drift rejection; `provenance.py:72-157`) as the attestation format binding each kernel measurement to MEASUREMENT.md ✅ 2026-07-22

### Follow-up discovered during C6 implementation — 2026-07-22
- [ ] The C6 harness (`scripts/kernel_rnd/c6_reward_integrity.py`) Linux sandbox (bwrap/unshare+RLIMIT) **fails closed** and is bypassed via `allow_unsandboxed` only because the devcontainer lacks bwrap/user-namespaces (it is itself the isolation boundary). Before real MI210 kernel-authoring runs, verify a working sandbox backend on the host and remove the unsandboxed override there.
