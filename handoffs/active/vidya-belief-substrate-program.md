# Vidya Belief-Substrate Program

**Status**: active
**Created**: 2026-08-09 (via research intake, operator-approved Stage-3 plan `linear-kindling-possum`)
**Categories**: knowledge_management, agent_architecture
**Audit record**: [`research/deep-dives/vidya-belief-substrate-audit.md`](../../research/deep-dives/vidya-belief-substrate-audit.md) (37 dive-verified sources, intake-1031..1067)
**v1 draft**: `tmp/vidya-epyc-governance-pilot-handoff.md` (2,682 lines; superseded as a plan by this handoff + the audit; retained as the source text for V2.1)

## Objective

Build the claim-level epistemic substrate the audit verified as EPYC's genuine gap: typed
claim/evidence/intent frames on an append-only ledger, a deterministic graded fold, refusal-
semantics freshness gating for research/wiki knowledge, and (later) provenance-gated actuation —
by **adopting** the frame/ledger prior art and spending all invention on the epistemic kernel.
Operator priority: an integrated solution that works, not novelty.

## Relationship & constraints (read before any task)

- **Rides, never rivals**: [`evidence-plane-ledger-and-sequential-verdicts.md`](evidence-plane-ledger-and-sequential-verdicts.md)
  conventions (per-question row shape, supersession folding, era discipline) and the
  `autokernel/journal.py` patterns (fsync-per-event, pure rebuild, `RETRIEVAL_SUPERSEDED`,
  view-consistency checks) are the house style this program extends to the research/wiki domain.
  The H1 non-overlap contract stands: the evidence plane remains authoritative for trial/verdict
  events.
- **Scope = the three verified gaps**: (1) claim-level dependency edges for research/wiki
  knowledge (NOT-FOUND as any existing design); (2) refusal-semantics freshness gating of
  knowledge; (3, later phase) provenance-gated actuation. Cross-worker snapshot coherence and the
  value-divergence axis are *related* diagnoses owned elsewhere — reference, don't absorb.
- **Read-only surfaces**: `MEASUREMENT.md` + annexes (human-amendment-only),
  `orchestration/instrument_eras.yaml` (append-only, human-written). Measurement artifacts are
  evidence; the constitution decides admissibility.
- **Vocabulary: map, don't fork**: `retro-certify`/`demote-to-prior`/`retire-view`
  (MEASUREMENT.md §6); `fresh`/`aging`/`stale`/`missing` + `observed|silent|absent` ×
  `populated|empty|unknown` (`dashboard/freshness.py` is "THE ONE CLASSIFIER" — any new freshness
  state must map onto or extend it explicitly); `accumulating`/`confirmed_improvement`
  (sequential verdicts).
- **Shadow-only until promotion**: nothing here gates a production decision; rollback = stop
  adapters, keep the ledger for diagnosis.

## Key file locations

- **The V2 output (start here — this is now the binding spec, not the v1 draft):**
  [`docs/design/vidya-pilot-spec.md`](../../docs/design/vidya-pilot-spec.md) ·
  [`docs/design/vidya-research-program.md`](../../docs/design/vidya-research-program.md) ·
  [`docs/design/vidya-architecture-appendix.md`](../../docs/design/vidya-architecture-appendix.md) (non-binding)
- Audit + adoption kit (all schemas/specs to copy): `research/deep-dives/vidya-belief-substrate-audit.md` §§4–5
- v1 draft (superseded source text for the V2 split): `tmp/vidya-epyc-governance-pilot-handoff.md`
- Intake entries with paste-ready extracts: `research/intake_index.yaml` intake-1031..1067
  (notably 1063 = byte-exact L1 checkpoint spec; 1062 = proof-standard definitions; 1064 =
  certificate field map; 1035 = judge-discipline rules)
- Existing machinery to ride: `handoffs/active/evidence-plane-ledger-and-sequential-verdicts.md`,
  `repos/epyc-inference-research/scripts/kernel_rnd/autokernel/journal.py`, `dashboard/freshness.py`

## Completed Scope

Landed and validated tracks — audit session, intake-index defects, V2 spec revision, P0 pilot
corpus, P1–P5 pilot build, the promotion track, and the R1–R5 research program — moved to
[`../completed/vidya-belief-substrate-program-completed-through-2026-08-10.md`](../completed/vidya-belief-substrate-program-completed-through-2026-08-10.md)
so the live work is visible here. Nothing was deleted; that file is the evidence record for every
gate this program has already passed.

## Task list

### Open work — start here

Outstanding tasks live in **Source coverage** (`SC6-LIVE`, `SC10`, `SC11`, `SC7`, `SC6-HAZARD`) and
**Consumption** (`SC14`, `SC15`). Everything else is complete and lives in the completed sibling
linked under Completed Scope.

The write side is done and the read side now exists: `cli.py cite-check` gates citations,
`cli.py corrections` ranks the adjudication backlog. The two open consumption items are the ones a
machine must not do alone — `SC14` needs the session that owns `autopilot.py`, `SC15` needs a human
reading dive text against claims.

### Source coverage — opened 2026-08-10 (operator question: what about wiki/logs/progress?)

- [x] SC1 **Measured the gap rather than assuming it.** The substrate models only what we READ:
      across 4,224 beliefs the Q axis is `Hinted 3,503 · Verified 709 · Q0 12` and **zero at
      Witnessed**, because spec §4.5 reserves Q4 for a protocol-admissible measurement with durable
      attestation and the only adapter reads literature. A quarter of the carrier is unreachable
      for a reason that is purely about which door the data came through ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC2 **Priced the retrofit before writing it** (the P2 discipline). Over `progress/`: 4,951
      lines carry a magnitude, **4,687 state a result, and only 105 (2.2%) cite anything durable** —
      most naming a source file, not a measurement artifact. A progress adapter would double the
      corpus and every claim would top out at `Verified/Located`, gating nothing ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC2-C **Corrected SC2's conclusion — it measured the wrong layer.** SC2 generalized a
      progress-markdown statistic into "our own measurements are recorded as prose too". Operator
      challenge: autopilot, autokernel and the kernel-freeze procedure follow an explicit
      measurement constitution. They do, and none of them writes to progress markdown, so the
      statistic said nothing about them. Verified structured corpus: **47 tracked ratification JSONs
      (34 carrying a sha256), 4,562 measurement-shaped tracked json/jsonl in the research repo, 14
      `artifacts/**/manifest.json` of which 6 are `SEALED_FOR_OFFICIAL_SCORING`**. The narrow
      finding (prose narration is unattested) survives; the generalization to the measurement layer
      is withdrawn ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC3 **Instrumented the WRITE for measurements** — `scripts/vidya/measurement_record.py`
      implements `MEASUREMENT_POLICY.md` § The claim rule as a grading function rather than
      paraphrasing it: no protocol → `Judged` (the constitution's OBSERVATION, never
      decision-gating); protocol without attestation → `Verified/Located`; artifact named but
      unhashed → `Witnessed/Anchored`; full tuple with the artifact present and hashed →
      `Witnessed/Attested`. Every downgrade names its own cause. Validation refuses a record it
      cannot grade honestly (category must be exactly one of OPTIMUM/BASELINE/CANDIDATE) ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC4 **Ingested the sealed-manifest corpus** — `scripts/vidya/adapters/sealed_manifest.py`.
      A sealed manifest already carries the constitution's full tuple (`capture_schema_version` →
      protocol, `arms.*.counts` → reps, `observational_provenance.sealed_at_utc` → date,
      `runner_sha256`/`authority/*.sha256` → attestation). **Q4 Witnessed: 0 → 6.** Two refusals are
      deliberate: an unsealed manifest is a run in progress, not a result; and a manifest whose named
      artifacts are absent grades DOWN rather than being skipped, because a hash over a missing file
      proves nothing ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC4-BUG **The adapter reproduced the fake-identity bug it exists to detect.** v1 keyed claims
      on the manifest directory basename; on the real tree `sealed_package` names two runs and
      `input` names three ARMS of one run, so 6 manifests folded into 3 claims and three arms of one
      A/B merged into a single belief. Caught by checking output count against input count, not by
      reading the output. Fixed to a path-relative identity, 12 bad frames retracted (9 collided + 3
      superseded), uniqueness pinned by `tests/vidya/test_sealed_manifest.py` ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC5 **Wiki pages are dependents, not claims** — `scripts/vidya/wiki_dependents.py`.
      **707 dependency edges from 28 pages into 477 distinct intake entries.** Implemented as a
      PROJECTION over the fold, writing nothing to the ledger: a page's citations are re-derivable
      from a file that is already in git, so appending them would have required either a new
      source-level edge frame or one structural "claim" per page — and that second option would put
      28 things in the belief set that are not beliefs. Result: **12 pages carry a stale dependency**
      (all unreviewed corrections), **zero real decay** ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC5-BUG **A coverage gap was being reported as decay.** The first draft flagged intake-12,
      intake-335, 303, 310, 48, 95, 16, 42, 98 as "lost all support". None has ever had a claim
      ingested — the substrate has not read those papers, which is a gap in us, not rot in the page.
      Now classified separately (`uningested` vs `unsupported`), and only decay marks a page stale.
      This moved the headline from 16 stale pages to 12 ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC5-MERGE **Verified the merge redirects rather than trusting a zero.** The report showed 0
      citations resolved through the merge map, which is the kind of silent negative that usually
      means a broken parser. Checked against ground truth: all 4 redirects parse correctly
      (784→244, 336→315, 797→418, 785→772) and the wiki cites none of them, because the merges
      repointed citations at merge time. All 477 cited ids resolve; none dangle ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC6-PRICE **Priced the bulk adapter before writing it, and it does not pay.** Sampled 50
      files from each of the four largest measurement areas (200 total) for the constitution's
      tuple:

      | Area | Files | protocol | reps | date | sha256 | **full tuple** |
      |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
      | `benchmarks/results` | 2,605 | 12% | 0% | 96% | 0% | **0%** |
      | `benchmarks/root_workload` | 1,156 | 40% | 0% | 40% | 0% | **0%** |
      | `data/batched_decode` | 387 | 88% | 10% | 70% | 0% | **0%** |
      | `artifacts/np_context_study_v8_20260727` | 659 | 42% | 0% | 22% | 64% | **0%** |

      **Zero of 200 carry the full tuple; `reps` is essentially never recorded and `sha256` is
      absent from three of four areas.** An adapter over these would add ~4,500 claims that all top
      out at `Verified/Located`, gating nothing — the identical trap SC2 correctly identified for
      progress prose. The bulk-ingest framing of SC6 is therefore REJECTED, not deferred.
      Correction: the original SC6 note cited `execution_manifest.jsonl`; no such file exists in
      the research repo ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC6 **Wired into autopilot's result-write path** (operator chose this hook over the
      llama-bench wrapper and a post-run sealing step, 2026-08-10). `ExperimentJournal.record()`
      now captures the constitution's tuple via `measurement_tuple()` — protocol from the schema
      versions plus the objective policy, reps from the scored denominator, date from the trial
      timestamp, attestation from a sha256 over the entry's own content. Replayed over all **1,372
      real historical rows: protocol_id 100%, date 100%, digest 100% (1,372 distinct), reps 86%**;
      the remaining 197 are skipped/invalid/never-scored trials where absence is correct.
      Read half: `scripts/vidya/adapters/autopilot_journal.py`. Grading stays in this repo next to
      `MEASUREMENT.md` so there is no second implementation of the claim rule to drift
      ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC6-REPS **The first extractor silently understated the corpus by 40 points.** It read only
      the modern denominator keys and found reps on 46% of rows. Probing the gap — rather than
      accepting it — found 545 older rows carrying the denominator under `details.total`.
      Recovering it took coverage to 86%. Because `total` counts what was ATTEMPTED while
      `quality_denominator` counts what SCORED, the tuple now records `reps_basis`, and the adapter
      states it in the grade reasons: "n=55 attempted" and "n=55 scored" are different claims
      ✅ 2026-08-10
- [ ] SC6-LIVE The hook takes effect for trials written **after autopilot next restarts** — the
      running process holds the pre-hook module. No restart was performed: reload ownership belongs
      to the session that owns the inference, at its own boundary. Until then
      `adapters/autopilot_journal.py` correctly reports 0 measured rows. Confirm non-zero after the
      next autopilot cycle
- [x] SC8 **The ingestion contract, so the next source is not re-derived from scratch.** The spec
      said what the carrier levels MEAN (§4.5) but never how a producer ENTERS it, so every adapter
      brought its own reading of the rule — and two were caught disagreeing on one input
      (`Judged/T0` vs `Judged/Located`). Now: adapters PROJECT into a canonical `ClaimTuple` and
      never grade; vocabulary is AutoKernel's `claim_grammar`; the carrier is shared but each
      **source class** has exactly one ladder (`measurement` → `Witnessed`; `literature` → capped at
      `Verified`, structurally). `register_ladder()` refuses a second, and a conformance test fails
      any adapter returning a lattice level without declaring itself one ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC8-DOC **Persisted in the three places someone will actually look**: spec §4.7 (the
      contract), `scripts/vidya/adapters/README.md` (implementer's guide + the live source
      register), and `CLAUDE.md` → *Belief Kernel — wiring new sources*. Explainer artifact updated
      with section B10 and the source register ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC9 **Standing practice adopted (operator, 2026-08-10): a process that produces measurements
      or verified findings gets its wiring task filed the MOMENT it is noticed** — one row in the
      source register, one task here. Rationale is an asymmetry, not tidiness: wiring the WRITE side
      is cheap and permanent, retrofitting the READ side is impossible, because a tuple invented on
      read claims warrant the original run never captured. `benchmarks/results` is the standing
      proof — 4,562 files, no write hook, 0 of 200 sampled carrying a usable tuple, permanently
      unable to gate a decision ✅ 2026-08-10
- [ ] SC10 **AutoKernel `evaluation_event` — ready, unwritten.** Its schema already enforces the
      claim rule as a REQUIRED block (stricter than the autopilot hook: `metric_direction`,
      `reps` ≥ 1, `anchor.source_commit`, hex-sha256 `run_id`, INVALID runs journaled not
      discarded). No adapter is needed until the loop emits records — **zero files on disk contain
      `claim_grammar` today**. Wire the read side when the first evaluation_event lands
- [ ] SC11 Survey the remaining candidate sources named in the register — llama-bench sweeps and the
      speech-kernel (whisper/qwentts) runs. Both need a write-side hook before a reader is worth
      anything; price each with the ~50-record sample before building
- [ ] SC7 Ingest autopilot trials into the ledger once SC6-LIVE confirms rows are landing. Deferred
      deliberately: appending 1,372 retro-graded claims now would record provenance the original
      runs never captured, and the corpus is worth ingesting only once it is born attested. Note
      `data/benchmark_artifact_inventory.json` is EMPTY (0 rows), which is its own finding
- [ ] SC6-HAZARD Before any bulk ingest is ever reconsidered: support is counted by **source
      locator**, so 2,605 separate result files measuring the same thing would read as 2,605
      independent witnesses. Same-harness runs are not independent evidence. A bulk adapter needs a
      run-level (not file-level) locator or it manufactures corroboration

### Consumption — opened 2026-08-10 (operator question: what consumes these beliefs?)

Audit finding that opened this section: **nothing outside `scripts/vidya/` read the fold.** A grep
across `scripts/`, `repos/epyc-orchestrator/scripts/` and `.claude/` returned zero references, and
the only projection on disk was a 2026-08-09 demo. The engine was complete and had no drivetrain.

- [x] SC12 **Citation gate** — `scripts/vidya/citation_gate.py`, `cli.py cite-check`. Scans project
      documents for `intake-NNN` citations, resolves them forward through the merge map, and applies
      a use policy to what they actually rest on. Live result over **1,754 citations in 142
      documents: 6 overturned, 3 conflicted, 144 resting on an unadjudicated correction.** Blocking
      is exactly `{dangling, overturned, conflicted}` — the three states a citer can act on today;
      `review` warns, per §10's auto-downgrade rule, because blocking on 571 review-required claims
      would fail most of the repository on the first run and get the tool switched off. Precise
      citations (`intake-896#03`) gate one claim and are the escape hatch ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC12-FIND **The gate found real damage on its first run.** `handoffs/active/intake-derived-work-2026-07-25.md`
      and `wiki/knowledge-management.md` both rest on intake-896, whose claim 03 a dive found
      **fabricated by a Stage-1 summariser**; three documents rest on intake-110 claim 04, a
      "+9–16 points" figure the authors themselves revised away upstream ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC13 **Correction adjudication queue** — `scripts/vidya/correction_queue.py`,
      `cli.py corrections`. The 103 `correction_reviewed` frames in the ledger came from a one-off
      backfill and **no code path emitted them**, so 571 claims were permanently BLOCKed for
      authoritative use. Now: `list` (ranked by how many documents cite the entry — a queue drained
      in id order is a queue nobody finishes), `worksheet` (every decision `pending`, which emits
      nothing), `emit` (writes `correction_reviewed` + the `claim_corrections` block for the index).
      **129 distinct corrections blocking 571 claims; 81 are cited.** End-to-end verified on a ledger
      copy: 6 claims BLOCK → ALLOW, pending rows untouched ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC13-DEFECT **Two silent defects found while building it.** (1) A correction recorded N times
      — 485 correction frames carry **155 distinct corrections**, because `per_claim_effects` was
      added as `{...} or None` and an explicit null changed the dedup key, re-emitting the corpus.
      `fold` blocks while ANY copy is unreviewed, so reviewing 3 of 4 leaves the claim blocked with
      nothing to show why; the queue now groups by content and emits one frame per copy, and
      `_dedup_key` drops informationless nulls so the next additive field cannot repeat it. (2) The
      queue read claim ids from the correction's own assertion and missed `clm_intake_374_03`, which
      only matches after alias resolution — claim ids are now read back out of the fold ✅ 2026-08-10
- [x] SC12-REGEX **Fixed a live defect in the shared citation scanner.** `citation_gate` reported a
      dangling citation to `intake-2602`, an entry that does not exist. Source text:
      `(intake-374/378/2602.11149 synthesis)` — the SC5 run-form pattern ate `/2602` out of an arXiv
      id. The first fix then let the engine backtrack into the partial number `260`; a `\b` anchor
      closes it. SC5's own numbers are unchanged (707 edges, 28 pages) — the bad citation was in a
      handoff, not a wiki page ✅ 2026-08-10
- [ ] SC14 **Planner read-side seam — the highest-value consumer, and not ours to wire.** AutoPilot's
      planner has independently reinvented much of this kernel: a mandatory falsifier, an append-only
      resolution ledger (confirmed/refuted/inconclusive), and `evidence_trial_ids: []` refused on a
      prior because *"being the operator's idea is not new evidence"* (`operator_hypotheses.py`).
      What it cannot do for itself: propagate a retraction when a trial that resolved a hypothesis is
      later invalidated; distinguish "confirmed by one noisy run" from "confirmed by a sealed
      measurement"; or share a negative with AutoKernel. **Wire at PROMOTION, never at generation** —
      gating hypothesis generation would turn a discovery loop into a justification loop, and trials
      are already born `CANDIDATE` (SC6), so the kernel's job is the CANDIDATE → BASELINE/OPTIMUM
      transition. Cost is not the obstacle: fold is 0.08 s over 20,328 frames and a gate query is
      0.001 ms. **Blocked**: `autopilot.py` is held by another session (`OPERATOR_HYPOTHESES_INTEGRATION.md`
      pins its SHA-256 and says so). Hand this to whoever owns that file
- [ ] SC15 **Drain the queue.** 129 corrections, 81 cited by project documents, top ones cited 5–7
      times. Not startable by a summariser: each verdict needs the dive text read against the claim,
      which is the exact failure intake-896 memorialises. Start with the cited head — `cli.py
      corrections` ranks it — and record `effect` per claim, never per entry

## Dependency notes

V2 blocks P1 (the pilot spec must exist before the engine). P0 can run in parallel with V2 (it is
operator + curation work). P2 depends on P1 (frames must exist). P3–P5 sequence after P1–P2.
R1/R2 are paper-track and independent; R3 deliberately severed; R4/R5 need pilot data.

## Decision queue — ALL SETTLED 2026-08-09

Retained as the ratification record. Nothing here blocks P1.

- [x] **1. Gold corpus** — ratified as drafted: 19 claims, four documented corrections + one E8
      measurement slice ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **2. `Corroborated`** — dropped from the carrier; independence is a policy predicate over the
      leaf-disjoint statistic ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **2b. Status-to-grade table** — ratified **with the tightening**: verifiers, tests, builds and
      actuation outcomes cap at `Q3`; `Q4 Witnessed` requires a protocol-admissible measurement, so
      `Q4` now means exactly "would be admissible as a decision-gating claim" ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **3. Carrier shape** — product lattice `Q × T` (warrant quality × traceability) ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **4. Sidecars + banners** — `.vidya/projections/` bound to article content hash; **no visible
      banner in shadow** (advisory display is measured not to change behaviour) ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **5. Canonical ledger** — append-only **JSONL is canonical** (house pattern: fsync-per-append,
      torn-tail handling), SQLite is a rebuildable derived index ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **6. Frame-type coverage** — `Trigger` **ADOPTED** as `pubinfo.triggered_by`, carrying no
      grade / authority / freshness; `Use`/`Generate` declared already covered by
      `derived_from`/`produced_by`. All nine survey relations now accounted for ✅ 2026-08-09
- [x] **7. Xu et al. 2018** — decline-with-citation; cited as R2 application precedent only ✅ 2026-08-09

## Cross-cutting concerns

- Any new freshness state must name its mapping onto `dashboard/freshness.py` classes.
- Any measurement claim consumed by the pilot cites protocol + era per MEASUREMENT.md; the pilot
  never re-grades measurement evidence.
- The P2 adapter changes the research-intake skill's write path — coordinate with any parallel
  intake session; never edit the skill mid-run.
- Judgment frames (any LLM verdict entering the ledger) must satisfy the V2.7 keying rules from
  day one — retrofitting replay keys is not possible.

## Reporting

Standard checkbox discipline (`- [x] … ✅ YYYY-MM-DD`; mid-flight discoveries get their own task
lines). Maintain the master-index and research-evaluation-index rows; on completion, extract
findings to docs, move to `completed/`, delete the master-index row.
