"""Score a Tulving episodic-memory benchmark result file offline.

``run_benchmark.py`` stores raw responses and generic throughput summaries.
This helper rehydrates Tulving ground truth from the dataset adapter and emits
the benchmark-specific Simple Recall and Chronological Awareness metrics.
It is safe to run on partial result files while a benchmark is still active.

It performs NO inference: it reads stored responses out of a result file and
re-derives ground truth from the local dataset parquet. Nothing in this module
or in ``tulving_episodic_adapter`` opens a socket or loads a model.

Subset discipline (M-12e): Simple Recall is computed over the ``get == "all"``
subset ONLY, and the Kendall tau leg of Chronological Awareness fails closed
unless the matched set covers the full ordered ground truth. See
``SCORER_VERSION`` below and the ``tulving_episodic_adapter`` module docstring
for the evidence that fixes those definitions.

Gold binding (M-12 B1): the 20ch and 200ch books reuse one question-index space, so
ground truth is bound to the CHAPTER SET the run used, never to a default. The set
comes from the rows (their ``provenance`` block and the ``<N>ch`` token in the id) or,
for a pre-B1 result that recorded neither, from ``--chapters``. The scorer refuses:

* a result whose rows record more than one set, or a set other than ``--chapters``;
* a row whose recorded set, variant, book digest or arm disagrees with the gold it
  would be graded against;
* a pre-B1 row (no recorded set) unless its stored prompt is byte-identical to the
  gold ``full``-arm prompt, the only prompt that names its book. Pre-B1 rows of the
  ``none``/``retrieved`` arms can never be bound and are refused.

Belief-kernel write side (SC67): ``--belief-measurements`` emits a
producer-authored ``belief_measurements.jsonl`` sidecar beside ``--out-json``,
projected by ``epyc-root:scripts/vidya/adapters/tulving_episodic.py``. It
requires ``--arm`` (checked against the stored prompts); the variant and chapter set
are the ones the gold binding resolved, and ``--variant``/``--chapters`` may only
restate them. A tuple that guesses the arm claims warrant the run never
captured. Runs scored before this hook existed emit zero rows, permanently —
including re-scores of them, whose arm identity was never recorded.
