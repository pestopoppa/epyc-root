# Unified AutoKernel implementation — 2026-09-09

Owner: `autokernel-unified-20260908`. Operator authorized implementation of
`handoffs/active/autokernel-unified-surface-program.md`, using GPT-5.6-sol medium workers for bounded
execution and main-thread coordination/review. Root lane starts at `088427b0`; research at `1d9733f1`.
Shared/divergent checkouts and frozen kernels were not changed. Implementation is tracked in §9;
source completion, publication, deployment and live acceptance are separate.

## Accepted first slices

- AKU-02a: `Recipe.explicit_unsets` removes inherited treatment values from the actual launched
  environment. Set/unset conflicts, malformed keys and loader-owned overrides refuse. Unset identity
  is immutable, sorted and serialized; empty unset state preserves historical recipe hashes. The
  existing readback path tests both control and treatment. Main reviewed the diff and integration tests.
- AKU-03a: `status.write_json()` now file-syncs, replaces atomically and syncs the containing directory.
  It cleans only its own unpublished temporary file, closes descriptors on failure and propagates
  post-publication durability failures without deleting the new target. Main reviewed implementation
  and injected-failure fixtures; 28 focused tests pass.
- Full current-loop suite after both patches: **611 passed, 59 subtests passed**, 6.88s. These are
  hermetic source tests, not inference measurements or proof of CPU/GPU performance/soak readiness.

## In progress and boundaries

Immutable campaign enrollment, journal-backed accumulator recovery and worker-heartbeat lifecycle
are assigned to disjoint sol-medium workers. A helper is not a completed parent slice until real
consumers and integration acceptance exist. The Vidya source table/task now registers the prospective
current-loop measurement hook. Operational journal snapshots are not claim tuples.

The built-in dispatcher retained two completed review threads and exhausted its thread limit; one new
sol-medium worker uses it and two use supported `codex exec` with explicit model/medium effort. Main
caps active concurrency at three, owns process handles, reviews proposals and publishes accepted files.
Research GitNexus was rebuilt at the starting commit. Recipe/status changes reported LOW impact;
heartbeat publication has MEDIUM scoped impact and needs race/consumer tests.

Retained gates: frozen production kernel set; no live research relaunch/soak without separate go and
held resources; no measurement-policy amendments; post-BIOS calibration/owning serving protocol.
OP-41 reserves real admission-control implementation to the operator after finalise → promote → reboot.
Main asked whether the new instruction delegates broker-code work now while retaining live gates;
no answer is inferred, and independent implementation continues.

Bus drain rejected this non-roster session ID. No peer identity or coordination file was impersonated.
Per-task wrap-up is being used for checklist/progress/index/publication. No index pruning, handoff
compaction or wiki compilation sweep is performed by this implementation checkpoint.
