# Verify a ggml-based binary loads ITS OWN libraries, not another tree's.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (INC-20260731-ggml-linkage-silent-cpu-fallback)
#
# This host sets, in /etc/environment:5 and .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:57 —
#
#   LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/AMD/aocc-compiler-5.0.0/lib:\
#                    /mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp/build/bin:\
#                    /mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp-dflash/build/bin:/opt/rocm/lib"
#
# The second entry is the FROZEN PRODUCTION KERNEL. Any freshly built ggml binary
# — whisper.cpp, qwentts.cpp, an experimental llama.cpp — resolves libggml-base /
# libggml-cpu / libggml-hip from THAT tree first, because the loader honours
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH before the binary's own directory.
#
# The failure is silent and produces plausible numbers. On 2026-07-31 a HIP-built
# whisper-cli loaded the production CPU-only ggml, found no GPU, and ran
# full-CPU while printing `use gpu = 1`. Had nobody checked, we would have
# published "GPU whisper" numbers that were CPU numbers. That is a measurement
# integrity failure, not a build annoyance: the run completes, the output is
# well-formed, and only the throughput is quietly wrong.
#
# RESOLVED 2026-07-31: the two llama.cpp entries were REMOVED from the global
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH (/etc/environment:5, .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:57,
# .devc/overrides.json:27). The old header here said "production tooling depends
# on finding the production libs there" — that premise was FALSE. Every binary in
# both production build dirs carries DT_RUNPATH=$ORIGIN and resolves its own
# siblings; an audit of 3192 ELF objects under /mnt/raid0/llm found exactly two
# consumers without a runpath, both unreferenced March-2026 scratch binaries.
#
# Worse, the global entries actively BROKE the GPU: under the old environment,
# /mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp/build-hip/bin/llama-server loaded all seven of its
# libraries from the CPU-only build/bin, and libggml-hip.so.0 was not loaded at
# all — because the CPU tree's libggml.so.0 carries no DT_NEEDED on it. The
# production GPU binary was silently a CPU binary.
#
# This script now guards against RE-INTRODUCING those entries. Third-party ggml
# trees (whisper.cpp, qwentts.cpp) still differ in ggml version, so a launcher that
# builds its own env must still prepend the project's own build dir and call this
# script to PROVE it worked:
#
#   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MY_BUILD/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
#   verify_ggml_linkage.sh "$MY_BUILD/bin/whisper-cli" "$MY_BUILD"
#
# NON-VACUITY IS INTRINSIC (2026-08-12). This script used to count matched ldd rows
# into FOUND, and when FOUND was 0 it printed "(no ggml/whisper/llama libs in ldd
# output — statically linked, or ldd failed)" as an INFORMATIONAL line and carried
# on to PASS, exit 0. So `verify_ggml_linkage.sh /bin/true <tree>` printed PASS:
# the strongest possible statement — "no library resolves outside this tree" — made
# from having inspected nothing at all. That is the EMPTY-INPUT vacuous pass, and
# a wrong path, a moved build dir, a stripped/static binary or an ldd that failed
# all render as a clean run.
#
# Two conditions now FAIL, both with exit code 2 so a consumer can tell "wrong
# tree" (1) from "this run proved nothing" (2):
#   * zero ggml/whisper/llama libraries inspected;
#   * libggml-base.so absent from the inspected set — EVERY ggml binary on this
#     host links it (whisper-server, tts-server, llama-server), so its absence
#     means the thing under test is not a ggml binary, however many other rows
#     ldd produced.
# scripts/session/verify_speech_kernels.sh (epyc-root) had to bolt exactly this
# gate on from the outside; a check that must be wrapped to be trustworthy is
# untrustworthy everywhere it is NOT wrapped. The `FAIL:`-prefixed output shape and
# the binary/expect header are preserved so both existing consumers' verdict
# regexes still parse (that wrapper, and autokernel's parse_linkage_report).
#
# Usage:  verify_ggml_linkage.sh <binary> [expected_tree_root]
#         expected_tree_root defaults to the binary's own directory.
# Exit:   0 = every ggml lib resolves inside the expected tree
#         1 = at least one resolves elsewhere  (DO NOT TRUST THE MEASUREMENT)
#         2 = VACUOUS / UNINSPECTABLE: nothing ggml was inspected, so this run is
#             not evidence of anything  (DO NOT TRUST THE MEASUREMENT)

FAIL: VACUOUS CHECK — nothing was inspected, so this run proves nothing.

    ggml/whisper/llama libraries inspected : $FOUND
    libggml-base.so seen                   : $CORE   (every ggml binary links it)

This is NOT a pass with a caveat. Reporting "no library resolves outside
$EXPECT" after inspecting $FOUND libraries would be the strongest possible claim
made from the weakest possible evidence.

Likely causes, in order: $BIN is not a ggml binary; it is statically linked; ldd
failed or was denied; the build directory moved. Point this at the real binary
(e.g. \$BUILD/bin/llama-server) and re-run before measuring anything.

if [ "$BAD" -gt 0 ]; then

FAIL: $BAD library/libraries resolve OUTSIDE $EXPECT.

This binary is running another tree's ggml. Any performance number produced now
is attributable to the WRONG BUILD, and a GPU build may silently execute on CPU
while still reporting a GPU device.

Fix:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$EXPECT/bin:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
then re-run this check before measuring.
