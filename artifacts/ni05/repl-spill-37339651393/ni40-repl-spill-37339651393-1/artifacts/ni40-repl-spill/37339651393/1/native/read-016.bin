"""File I/O tool methods for the REPL environment.

This module is a re-export shim for backward compatibility.
The implementation has been split into focused mixins:
- file_exploration: peek, grep, list_dir, file_info
- archive_tools: archive_open, archive_extract, archive_file, archive_search
- external_access: web_fetch, run_shell
- file_mutation: log_append, file_write_safe, patch tools

All methods are combined in the _FileToolsMixin class.

    Required attributes (provided by REPLEnvironment.__init__):
        config: REPLConfig — environment configuration
        context: str — full input context
        artifacts: dict — collected artifacts

        _grep_hits_buffer: list — grep results buffer
        _validate_file_path: Callable[[str], tuple[bool, str | None]] — path validation method
        _ocr_document: Callable[[str], str] — OCR document processor (from DocumentToolsMixin)
