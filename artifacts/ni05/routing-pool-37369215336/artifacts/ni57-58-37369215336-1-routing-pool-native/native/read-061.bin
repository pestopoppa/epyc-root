"""memory_record.py — the single shape every episodic memory is written in.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A 2026-07-27 audit of the episodic store found that its six write sites had each
grown their own record shape and their own embedding text, with four measurable
consequences:

1. **Two incompatible key names for the same field.** 30,571 rows put the task
   text in ``objective``; 27,562 put it in ``task_description`` alongside
   telemetry (``question_id``, ``elapsed_seconds``, ``tokens_generated``, ...).
   Both are real task memories — an earlier reading of this split as "half the
   store is telemetry with no task text" was WRONG and is corrected here — but a
   consumer that reads only one key silently sees half the store, which is
   exactly how that misreading happened. The contract has one field name.
2. **Objectives were truncated to 200 chars at write time**, so the text was
   *gone*, not merely unindexed. 12.6% of rows sat exactly at the cap, and only
   2,639 distinct objectives existed across 54,960 rows (96.9% collision).
3. **At least four embedding conventions** coexisted, so the vector encoded
   *which writer produced the row* — a probe read the writer path off the
   embedding at ROW-AUC 0.906-0.940, and the two paths differed up to 8x in
   failure rate.
4. **Nothing stored the work.** No answer, no tool calls, no REPL steps, no
   reasoning. So retrieval could only ever return "here is a similar task stub,
   and it succeeded" — never "here is how it was solved". That ceiling is
   visible in SkillBank's output: all 57 distilled skills are thin routing
   heuristics, because a routing heuristic is the only thing extractable from
   ``(stub, role, success-bit)``.

Operator decision, 2026-07-27: store the works — answers, tool calls, REPL
steps, reasoning traces. Storage is not the constraint (answers measure ~1.1 KB
mean; p50 is 58 tokens), and distillation is measured at 10:1.

THE ONE INVARIANT
-----------------
**What gets EMBEDDED is not what gets STORED.**

    embedding_text()  -> the task only, one convention, bounded length.
                         This is what similarity search matches on, so it must
                         describe the QUESTION. Embedding the answer would make
                         retrieval match solutions against solutions.

    to_context()      -> the full record: untruncated objective plus the work.
                         Never fed to the embedder.

Telemetry rides in ``metrics`` and is excluded from the embedding text by
construction, so performance fields can never influence similarity search.

# 0 of 59,337 rows carried `work`. Wiring them means episodic rows now hold model
# OUTPUT and TOOL OUTPUT, which is the first content in this store that can carry
# a credential or an unbounded blob. Two properties are enforced here, at the
# single construction chokepoint (`build_memory_record`), rather than at each
# write site — the same reasoning as the degenerate-embedding refusal in
# EpisodicStore.store(): a guarantee placed at N call sites is lost by caller
# N+1.
#
# 1. REDACTION reuses the repo's ONE credential policy,
#    src.repl_environment.redaction.redact_if_enabled (feature-gated on
#    credential_redaction, default True). No second pattern list is invented
#    here. Note redact_credentials() SKIPS inputs above 1 MB, so the caps below
#    also keep every scanned string inside the scanner's working range.

#    Sizing sanity: answers measure ~1.1 KB mean / 58 tokens p50, so the text cap
#    is ~29x the mean and does not bite in normal operation — it exists to bound
#    a looping generation or a dumped file, not to compress ordinary work.
