"""NIB2-80: the EARLY_ABORT escalation path must respect cfg.max_escalations.

Before the fix, `FrontdoorNode` (and its siblings WorkerNode/CoderNode/
CoderEscalationNode/IngestNode) escalated unconditionally on
ErrorCategory.EARLY_ABORT without calling `_should_escalate`, so a run that
kept early-aborting could blow through `max_escalations` — the budget it was
nominally charged against was never actually read.

Reading chosen (see handoff NIB2-80 + agent report): immediate escalation on
early-abort is deliberate (it deliberately skips the retry precondition that
`_should_escalate` enforces for other categories — routing early-abort through
`_should_escalate` unmodified would block first-strike escalation until
`consecutive_failures >= max_retries`, which is a behaviour change beyond
closing the budget hole). The minimal, behaviour-preserving fix is to gate the
early-abort branch on `state.escalation_count < cfg.max_escalations` and, when
the budget is exhausted, fall through to the exact same
think-harder / `_should_escalate` / `_should_retry` / fail chain that every
sibling site already uses when its own gate refuses.
