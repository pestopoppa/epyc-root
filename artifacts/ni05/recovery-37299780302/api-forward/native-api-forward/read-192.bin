"""The contention matrix must carry its own host-health provenance.

ORIGIN. Found 2026-08-12 while dry-running the OP-21 overlapping contention
re-bench BEFORE spending a post-reboot window on it.

`_host_metadata()` collected `uptime` and `kernel`; `_emit_yaml` wrote only
`host: <hostname>` and discarded both. The emitted matrix had no
`host_health_warnings` and no `decision_grade`, and stamped
`verdict: allow/block` with `samples: 1` regardless of host state.

CONSEQUENCE, and the reason this is a test and not a comment: a run at 14.1 d
uptime landed BYTE-INDISTINGUISHABLE from a clean-host measurement. Nobody
reading the artifact later could tell which one they were holding — so a
reboot window bought a number that could not prove the host was clean, which
is the only thing the reboot was for.

THE FAILURE MODE THIS FILE GUARDS is not "the field is wrong". It is "the
field is ABSENT, and absence renders as a pass". Every test below that
exercises an unknown asserts on `decision_grade is False` AND on the presence
of a warning that names what could not be established, because a silent
`decision_grade: true` on an unprobed host is exactly the vacuity class this
repo tracks.

NO INFERENCE, NO SERVER, NO BENCH. Every test here calls the emitter and the
probe directly.
