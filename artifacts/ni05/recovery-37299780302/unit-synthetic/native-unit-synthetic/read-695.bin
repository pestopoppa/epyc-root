"""Both KB-RAG ONNX encoders must bound the ORT intra-op pool.

ORIGIN. `src/tools/web/colbert_reranker.py` was fixed on 2026-08-12 (19111369)
after ONNX Runtime's default pool — one thread per visible core, 192 here — was
measured costing 1.8-2.3x on small forward passes. The two `src/retrieval/`
encoders build their sessions the same unbounded way and are **live by default in
KB-RAG**, so they carried the same penalty on the request path.

THE POINT OF THIS FILE, and why the two defaults differ. The obvious move was to
copy the reranker's 8 into both. Measured, that is wrong: the optimum is
CALL-SHAPE dependent.

    colbert_encoder.encode()    -> ONE single-row pass.  best 4t, 8t within 3%.
    cross_encoder.score_pairs() -> N rows in ONE run().  best 16t at BOTH batch
                                   10 and 50; 8t costs ~40% at batch=50.

So `cross_encoder` deliberately uses 16 while its siblings use 8, and
`test_the_two_defaults_are_not_silently_unified` exists to stop a future tidy-up
from "harmonising" them back to one number. That would look like cleanup and cost
40% on the batched path, silently, with every test still green.

WHAT IS PINNED. Behaviour, not spelling: that SessionOptions reaches the real
InferenceSession call with a positive intra-op bound strictly below the host core
count. `< os.cpu_count()` is the load-bearing assertion — it is what fails if
anyone drops the options and returns to ORT's default.
