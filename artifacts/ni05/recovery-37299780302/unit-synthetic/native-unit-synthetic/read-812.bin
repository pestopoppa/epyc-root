    This was a hardcoded {"frontdoor", "worker_general", "ingest_long_context",

    The 2026-09-22 cutover made worker_general (with worker_explore / worker_math /
    toolrunner / worker / worker_summarize) an alias on frontdoor's :8070 process,
    so the literal asserted HOST agreement about an ALIAS — and the readers then
    disagreed exactly as they are designed to: the launch views report the instances
    an alias is TAGGED onto (stack_manifest.py, shared_with_first_n_count), the
    serving view reports the whole host fleet the alias is actually served from
    (WP-13 fleet convergence, stack_priors.py ~1241, whose comment records that
    emitting only the tagged ports serialized worker_math eval traffic on one
    quarter). [8080] vs [8080, 8180] is that divergence, asserted by the sibling
    test below as CORRECT. ingest_long_context and vision_escalation are aliases
    too, and passed only vacuously: their GPU hosts run one instance in every mode.

    Deriving the set also covers every NEW host role automatically, and is strictly
    wider than the literal it replaces (15 roles, of which the literal named 1).
