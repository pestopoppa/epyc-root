"""Aux-service launch environment — composition, isolation and non-regression.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (INC-20260731-ggml-linkage-silent-cpu-fallback)

The three kernel trees run three different ggml generations: llama.cpp 0.16.0,
qwentts.cpp 0.17.0, whisper.cpp 0.18.0. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` outranks `DT_RUNPATH`
in the dynamic loader's search order, so a binary that inherits an ambient path
containing a foreign tree loads that tree's ggml even though its own RUNPATH
points at its siblings. The result is not a crash — it is a well-formed answer
produced by the wrong code. On 2026-07-31 a HIP whisper-cli loaded the production
CPU-only ggml, printed `use gpu = 1`, and ran entirely on the CPU.

Until 2026-08-02 both env composers were PREPEND-ONLY and every `start_*` began
at `os.environ.copy()`, so no service could be told to IGNORE the ambient path.
Prepending is not sufficient here: it wins for libraries the tree ships, which
leaves the WORST outcome reachable — whisper's 0.18.0 `libggml-hip` loaded
against llama.cpp's 0.16.0 `libggml-base`, an ABI mismatch that does not raise.
