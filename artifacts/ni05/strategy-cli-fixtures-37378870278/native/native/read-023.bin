"""Per-tier scoring specifications for the autopilot Pareto archive + safety gate.

Quality (`fraction_correct * 3`) is computed on a per-tier question set and the tiers differ
in difficulty (T0 ~10 easy q saturates ~2.4; T1 ~50 mixed ~1.6-1.9; T2 ~480 incl. GPQA/olympiad
~1.16; T3 expert/hard workflow rows), so quality is NOT comparable across tiers. The archive
and safety gate are therefore tier-segregated: each eval tier >= MIN_FRONTIER_EVAL_TIER keeps
its OWN frontier + baseline, and a trial is only ever ranked / gated against the SAME tier.

A `TierSpec` defines how a tier's objective tuple is built and its hypervolume reference point.
This keeps per-tier scoring **pluggable**: a future, more complex tier can carry different quality
semantics (its own scale/metric) by registering a different spec — without confounding existing
tiers or re-plumbing the archive/gate. All CURRENT tiers share the 4D
`(quality, speed, -cost, reliability)` shape and the canonical reference point.

This module is the SINGLE source of truth for tier scoring and is imported the same way
(`from src.autopilot_core.tier_specs import ...`) by both `scripts/autopilot` (which puts
ORCH_ROOT on sys.path) and `src/api`, so `TIER_SPECS` is one shared registry object.

# metrics. They are deliberately NOT changed here: they feed archived objectives and
# `eval_details.goodput_qph`, and rescaling them would silently rewrite recorded history.
#
# The sequential rate axis needs something they do not provide: the CANDIDATE side and
# the INCUMBENT side must be the SAME measurement, or an unchanged config scores a rate
# regression. They were not the same measurement:
#
#   * `EvalTower._aggregate_decision_partitions` returns an EvalResult whose
#     `n_questions` / `details.total` counts only the DECISION partition (audit-shadow
#     questions excluded), while `eval_wall_s` is `max(r.eval_wall_s)` over the FULL
#     batch — the wall clock of every question that was actually asked. So the
#     candidate's `task_rate_qph_from` divides 55 questions by the wall time of 65.
#   * the incumbent comparator built in `autopilot._seq_inputs_for_trial` passed
#     `n_questions=len(outcome_map)`, i.e. the FULL question_results list that
#     `_aggregate_decision_partitions` explicitly copies over from the full result — 65.
#
# Measured over the 396 journaled sequential trials (2026-08-04): 381 carry
# `audit_shadow_excluded_partitions == ['audit']`, and the candidate/incumbent rate
# ratio is exactly 55/65 = 0.8462 (median; 50/60 = 0.8333 at p25). A candidate
# IDENTICAL to the incumbent therefore scored y = -0.1538 => z_rate = -0.208, i.e.
# negative rate evidence on every single trial, forever.
#
# The functions below are the ONE measurement both sides of the rate axis use. The
# numerator is the number of questions the wall clock ACTUALLY covers.

# A trial whose eval wall clock implies less than this per question did not measure a
# throughput — it aborted (fast-reject / crashed batch). Journal evidence: the 7 rows
# below 1.0 s/question are ALL `pareto_status=dominated`, and the extreme is trial 1302
# at 0.0008 s/question (65 questions in 0.054 s => 4.3 MILLION questions/hour). The
# legitimate distribution is p10 = 11.7 s/question, median 17.4. One such row inside a
# 120-row arithmetic MEAN moves the comparator by ~36,000 qph and pins every subsequent
# candidate at the `rate_noninferiority_z` clip floor. 1.0 s/question is far below any

# ── W3 live-vector flip (2026-08-04, operator): dominance ranks TASKS/HOUR ──────
#
# The operator flipped the live dominance vector off tokens/second. Three findings
# shaped HOW, and none of them is the flag-flip the W3b-C tripwire implied:
#
# 1. The 3D `task_rate_3d_v1` shadow vector CANNOT become the live vector. Consumers
#    index the tuple POSITIONALLY past axis 1 — `safety_gate.py` reconstructs
#    `cost=-objectives[2], reliability=objectives[3]` and refuses any entry with
#    `len(objectives) < 4` ("frontier representative missing objective tuple"), and
#    `pareto_archive.py` reads `[2]`/`[3]` for its frontier summaries. Going 3D would
#    not have raised — it would have SILENTLY blocked every baseline promotion behind a
#    misleading message. `objectives_from` is documented as the single chokepoint, but a
#    chokepoint on CONSTRUCTION is not one on CONSUMPTION. So the 4D shape is preserved
#    and only axis 1's UNIT changes: t/s -> questions/hour, still "rate, higher better".
#
# 2. The rate metric had to be the CORRECTED one. `task_rate_qph_from` divides the
#    decision-partition question count by the FULL-batch wall clock, so `n` moving
#    43 -> 38 drops the objective ~12% with no change in real throughput (measured:
#    trial 775 qph=202.9 @ 51.5 t/s vs trial 778 qph=170.5 @ 49.8 t/s — a 19% objective
#    gap from a 3% speed difference). It also returns 0.0 for "unavailable" on 128 of
#    1466 journal rows, which archives an unmeasured trial as maximally slow.
#    `seq_task_rate_qph_from` counts the questions the wall clock actually covers,
#    returns None rather than 0.0, and rejects aborted batches.
#
# 3. An unmeasured rate must SKIP the archive, never enter it as a number. That is the
#    same doctrine as the `throughput_unmeasured` safety-gate category and SEQ-3a's
#    out-of-domain z handling: absence is not zero.
# The serving scheduler is part of a questions/hour instrument. v1 measured
# serial/client-global eval placement; v2 measured full-instance resource lanes;
# v3 classifies homogeneous native batches versus mixed-role split pipelines
# before dispatch; v4 adds the pre-dispatch long-context capacity guard after
# E12 exposed a 175K-token prompt on a latency worker. Same tuple shape,
# different denominator instruments: never mix them in one frontier.
