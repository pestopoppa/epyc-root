# reference, which revision (EV-14c), or which eval_quality era was compared, it
# silently reads 0.0 out of an unrelated sentence, and it disappears entirely when
# the gate PASSES (no regression line is written on a pass, so a clean trial
# recorded no baseline at all). `baseline_pin` records the reference identity
# beside the delta so the comparison is self-contained.
#
# Written by the trial writer via `build_baseline_pin()`; read by
# `baseline_pin_for()`, which prefers the structured field and falls back to the
# regex ONLY for rows written before this field existed — marking the fallback
# (`source="legacy_failure_analysis_regex"`) and logging it once per trial, so a
# legacy read is never mistaken for a recorded pin. Legacy shards stay loadable:
