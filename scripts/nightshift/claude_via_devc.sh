# claude_via_devc.sh — Claude Code proxy through devcontainer
#
# Passes all arguments to claude inside the project devcontainer,
# which has bypassPermissions mode enabled. Nightshift uses this
# as its claude binary to avoid host-side permission issues.
#
# The devcontainer:
#   - Has defaultMode: bypassPermissions
#   - Mounts /mnt/raid0/llm (shared git repo + worktree)
#   - Runs as user 'node'
#   - Can create branches, edit files, commit
#   - Cannot push to GitHub (no gh auth) — nightshift handles push on host
#
# Nightshift operates in a worktree at /mnt/raid0/llm/epyc-root-nightshift
# to avoid disrupting agents working on main in /mnt/raid0/llm/epyc-root.
