# Chapter 02: Storage Architecture & Safety

## Introduction

The system's storage architecture enforces a strict separation between the **120GB OS SSD** (root filesystem) and **4TB RAID0 NVMe array** (models, caches, temporary files). This chapter documents the storage rules, the 192-thread pytest danger that exhausted 1.13TB RAM, and the HOT/WARM/COLD memory pool design.

Violating the storage rules causes **system instability and crashes**. Writing large files to root triggers paging storms that freeze the machine and corrupt the OS. The environment variables and path verification checks in this chapter are **non-negotiable safety requirements**.

## Root Filesystem Crisis & Recovery

In December 2025, Claude Code filled `/tmp/claude` with 20GB of data and crashed the machine. The application creates that directory before any runtime configuration takes effect, so our "write only to `/mnt/raid0/`" rule couldn't prevent it. The fix was a three-layer defense: a bind mount that silently redirects `/tmp/claude` to the RAID array, real-time monitoring that alerts at 70% and 85% usage, and an emergency cleanup script for when things go sideways anyway.

<summary>Incident details and three-layer defense</summary>

### What Happened (2025-12-18)

Claude Code filled `/tmp/claude` with 20GB of data, exhausting the 84GB root filesystem and crashing the system. The application creates `/tmp/claude` before AI prompt instructions are evaluated, bypassing the "write only to `/mnt/raid0/`" constraint.

**Root Cause**: Application-level cache directory creation happens before runtime configuration.

<details>
<summary>Code: Layer 1 — Bind Mount</summary>

```bash
# Create bind mount at session start
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/claude
sudo mount --bind /mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/claude /tmp/claude

# Verify mount is active
mountpoint /tmp/claude
# Output: /tmp/claude is a mountpoint
```

</details>

The bind mount makes `/tmp/claude` a "portal" to the RAID array. Writes to `/tmp/claude` physically go to `/mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/claude`, preventing root FS exhaustion.

<details>
<summary>Code: Layer 2 — Real-Time Monitoring</summary>

```bash
# Run in background during sessions
bash /mnt/raid0/llm/UTILS/monitor_storage.sh &

# Alerts:
# - 70% full: Warning logged
# - 85% full: Critical alert + system notification
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Code: Layer 3 — Emergency Recovery</summary>

```bash
# If system fills up:
sudo bash /mnt/raid0/llm/UTILS/emergency_cleanup.sh

# Actions:
# 1. Stop Claude processes
# 2. Unmount bind mount
# 3. Delete /tmp/claude
# 4. Report before/after usage
```

<details>
<summary>Allowed vs forbidden paths</summary>

| ✅ ALLOWED (RAID Array) | ❌ FORBIDDEN (Root FS) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/` | `/home/` (except symlinks) |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/epyc-orchestrator/` | `/tmp/` (except via bind mount) |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/cache/` | `/var/` |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/models/` | `~/.cache/` |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/` | `~/.local/` |

**Mandatory Path Verification**:

```bash
# Before ANY file write operation
[[ "$TARGET_PATH" == /mnt/raid0/* ]] || { echo "ERROR: Path not on RAID!"; exit 1; }
```

</details>

## Storage Layout

The RAID0 array holds everything: 2.1TB of GGUF models, 850GB of HuggingFace source models, caches, temp files, and the project itself. The OS drive is kept lean at under 70% capacity. RAID0 gives us 12.5 GB/s sequential reads — fast enough to mmap a 280GB model in about 22 seconds.

<details>
<summary>RAID0 NVMe array layout</summary>

| Directory | Purpose | Typical Size |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/models/` | GGUF quantized models | 2.1TB (90 models) |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/hf/` | HuggingFace format models | 850GB (source models) |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/cache/` | HF/pip caches | 120GB |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/` | Temporary files (TMPDIR) | 50GB (cleaned daily) |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/epyc-orchestrator/` | Project docs & scripts | 8GB |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp/` | Production toolchain | 2GB |
| `/mnt/raid0/llm/llama.cpp-experimental/` | Experimental worktree | 2GB |

**RAID Configuration**: 2× Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB NVMe in RAID0 (stripe size 64KB)

<details>
<summary>Data: RAID performance numbers</summary>

- Sequential read: 12.5 GB/s

## 192-Thread Pytest Danger

Running `pytest -n auto` on a 192-thread machine is catastrophic. Each worker loads its own copy of the embedding models (~3GB per worker), and 192 of those exhausts the full 1.13TB of RAM. This actually happened in January 2026 and crashed the machine. The fix was three-fold: lazy model loading that skips init in test mode, a memory guard that fails tests early if free RAM drops below 100GB, and a hook that blocks `-n auto` entirely.

<summary>Incident and safeguards</summary>

### Memory Exhaustion Incident (2026-01-13)

An agent ran orchestration liveness tests with `pytest -n auto`, spawning ~192 worker processes. Each worker initialized the API, loading TaskEmbedder (~2-3GB) and QScorer (~1GB).

**Result**: 192 workers × 3GB = **576GB allocation**, exceeding the 1.13TB RAM budget when combined with existing HOT tier (~535GB).

<details>
<summary>Code: Lazy MemRL Loading safeguard</summary>

```python
from src.features import features

if features().memrl and not features().mock_mode:
    # Load MemRL components only in production with real_mode=True
    embedder = TaskEmbedder()
    qscorer = QScorer()
else:
    # Tests use mock mode - no model loading
    embedder = None
    qscorer = None
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Code: Memory Guard in conftest.py</summary>

```python
import psutil

def pytest_configure(config):
    mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
    free_gb = mem.available / (1024**3)

    if free_gb < 100:
        raise RuntimeError(
            f"Insufficient memory for tests: {free_gb:.1f}GB free, need 100GB"
        )
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Code: Makefile memory check</summary>

```makefile
check-memory:
    @python3 -c "import psutil; m = psutil.virtual_memory(); \
        assert m.available > 100*(1024**3), \
        f'Need 100GB free, have {m.available/(1024**3):.1f}GB'"
```

</details>

### Safe Test Commands

```bash
# ✅ Safe: Sequential execution
pytest tests/

# ✅ Safe: Limited parallelism (max 4 workers)
pytest tests/ -n 4

# ❌ DANGEROUS: Spawns ~192 workers!
pytest tests/ -n auto  # DO NOT USE
```

**Rule**: NEVER use `pytest -n auto` on this 192-thread machine. Limit to `-n 4` maximum.

</details>

## HOT/WARM/COLD Memory Architecture

The orchestrator uses a three-tier memory pool that takes advantage of the 1.13TB RAM. HOT models (~535GB) are always resident and ready to serve. WARM models (~460GB) get mmap'd on demand — the NVMe RAID can page them in at 12GB/s, so loading a 140GB model takes about 12 seconds. COLD models sit on disk until explicitly needed.

<details>
<summary>HOT tier — always resident</summary>

| Port | Role | Model | Size | Speed |
|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 8080 | frontdoor | Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M | ~17GB | 18 t/s |
| 8081 | coder_escalation | Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Q4_K_M | ~19GB | 39 t/s (spec) |
| 8082 | worker_explore | Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-f16 | ~14GB | 44 t/s (spec) |
| 8084 | architect_coding | Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Q4_K_M | ~280GB | 10.3 t/s |
| 8086 | worker_vision | Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Q4_K_M | ~4GB | ~15 t/s |
| 8090-8095 | embedder (6x) | BGE-large-en-v1.5-F16 | ~4GB | probe-first |
| 9001 | document_formalizer | LightOnOCR-2-1B | ~2GB | 19x PDF speedup |

**Draft models** (shared by spec decode): ~0.5GB each

**Total HOT**: ~535GB (includes OS, buffers, KV caches)

</details>

<details>
<summary>WARM tier — on-demand mmap</summary>

| Role | Model | Size | When Loaded |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| architect_general | Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M | ~140GB | Escalation to B3 tier |
| ingest_long_context | Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Q4_K_M | ~45GB | Long-context synthesis |
| vision_escalation | Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M | ~17GB | Complex vision tasks |

**Loading**: mmap() with `--no-mmap false` allows on-demand paging from NVMe (~12GB/s sequential read).

**Eviction**: Automatic via OS page cache when memory pressure increases.

</details>

<details>
<summary>COLD tier and memory budget</summary>

### COLD Tier (Disk Only)

Models on disk, not loaded into memory:
- Benchmark test models
- Deprecated models
- Alternative quantizations (Q2_K, Q3_K_M, etc.)

**Total COLD**: ~1.5TB on `/mnt/raid0/llm/models/`

### Memory Budget Example

```
HOT tier (always loaded):     535GB (47%)
WARM tier (on-demand mmap):   460GB (41%)
OS + buffers + headroom:      135GB (12%)
Total capacity:              1130GB (100%)
```

**Safe margin**: Keep 100GB+ free for KV caches, tensor operations, and tests.

</details>

## Storage Monitoring

Day-to-day maintenance is simple: clean temp files older than 24 hours, clear pytest caches, and check that both the root drive and RAID array have healthy free space. The key numbers: root FS under 70%, RAID with 500GB+ free, and 100GB+ available RAM.

<details>
<summary>Cleanup and health check commands</summary>

<details>
<summary>Code: daily cleanup</summary>

```bash
# Clean old temporary files (>24h)
find /mnt/raid0/llm/tmp/ -type f -mtime +1 -delete

# Clean old extraction directories
python3 -c "from src.services.archive_extractor import ArchiveExtractor; \
    ArchiveExtractor.cleanup_expired(max_age_hours=24)"

# Clean pytest cache
find /mnt/raid0/llm/epyc-orchestrator -name ".pytest_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Code: health checks</summary>

```bash
# Check root FS usage
df -h /
# Must be < 70% (< 84GB used)

# Check RAID array usage
df -h /mnt/raid0
# Should have > 500GB free

# Check memory usage
free -h
# Should have > 100GB available
```
